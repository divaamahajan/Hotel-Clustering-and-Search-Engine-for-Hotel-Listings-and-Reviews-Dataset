# Hotel-Clustering-and-Search-Engine-for-Hotel-Listings-and-Reviews-Dataset
This project clusters hotels and builds a search engine for hotel listings and reviews using NLP techniques. Hotel descriptions are encoded and clustered, and a search engine is built using FAISS to allow users to search for hotels based on their queries.
