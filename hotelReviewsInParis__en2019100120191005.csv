0,Forgot to book a large bed so given a room with 2 singles and they are small (I am a normal BMI adult and almost fell out several times in night).So very tired.Food very good albeit limited choiceService very goodBathroom weird - toilet quite removed from sink and shower I would t stay again but cause sleep is important for me. Am sure if you have a proper double or larger bed your sleep will be fine,"July 12, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

1,"This hotel was really nice overall but they location was really bad. One hour from Charles De gaulle airport and pretty far from most of the attractions. However, it is really close to the train station. They had a nice buffet breakfast and they treated us nicely. ","July 10, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

2,Our complimentary breakfast was delicious. Staff was kind and helpful. Our beds were comfortable and our room was cool. Was a ten minute walk to the Metro from where we embarked on all our sightseeing destinations.,"July 3, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

3,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Staff completely unhelpful. Booked this room as the hotel boasts having air conditioning in all rooms. Got a room that is over 85 degrees inside for me, my husband and 2 kids (one who is asthmatic). The temperature outside is over 95 degrees so opening a window is not an option. Told the staff the issue upon check in at 3:30 and said they would send someone. Got back to room at 11:30 pm, no one came by and when we went back down, only option was to wait till the next day to see if anything became available but no promises could be made in respect. We had to beg for a fan which they finally gave us begrudgingly and did nothing to cool it down and was extremely loud! While I am not French, I do understand quite a bit and had to hear them ridicule me as I walked away for being American! Ridiculous and completely blown away that a hotel treats guests this way.","June 25, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

4,"This was a comfortable hotel in Montparnasse not to far from the Montparnasse Tower. The room was nice and the bathroom had amenities. The air conditioning was on and the room was comfortably cool. It was quiet at night so we were able to sleep well.The breakfast was really good, with a large variety of hot and cold items. There were many restaurants and shops nearby.","June 7, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

6,"We booked the hotel for the last night of our France vacation. We arrived early from the champagne region and this is what went on:10am - we were told that the hotel was overbooked and that they had rooms available, offered a room at a different hotel. Mind you, we were early there so they could’ve given un any room. We declined, spoke to the manager Marian, she said they would give us a room but we would have to wait4pm, came back to the hotel, checked in and they put us in a room on the 7th floor (alleged upgrade) you could see vacuums, water extractors, construction materias everywhere and not a single soul on site.9:30pm my husband took a shower and there was an overflow, water everywhere (we realized that all the equipment we had seen earlier was due to something similar) 9:30-10p back and forth with front desk “we can have someone check it out in the morning” “we are going to open another room so you can shower there for 30min-1hr” “you can’t use that other room due to sanitary issues” just like we suspected, our room was part of the problem. 10:15pm after bickering, once again they offered another hotel and at this time we had no choice. At this time, there were other guests trying to check in but no rooms were available. Rude taxi driver and we got to the other hotel and checked in past 10:45pm. I was able to take a shower there. To sum this up, this hotel is a scam, they have no respect, they exposed my family to God knows what in a dirty, sewer water infested room and floor and treated us like garbage. Accor hotels, don’t bother apologizing here and twisting my story around, there is no way you can make this up to me because I am never ever booking a room with you. Refund me for my stay. Please I beg of you, don’t book it, it’s a fraud. See photos","June 1, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

7,On business I stayed at this Novotel 2 nites recentlyThe best Paris experience in the price range1) 200+ is seldom seen in central Paris2) 18 Euro for a full buffet breakfast with omelettes waffles cappuccino coffee. Pastries juices etc3) walk to the Metro4) 1.2km from the Eiffel Tower5) dozens of restaurants in walking distance6) outside the high end tourist area so restaurants were more reasonably priced7) clean room8) friendly courteous competent staffMy first choice when I next visit Paris!,"May 23, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

13,"27 degrees outside and the Hotel is not able to switch the air conditioning on for the Hotel rooms. Even after speaking to the hotel manager, who promised to switch it on, they did not.

16,We chose this hotel because it is close to the Gare Montparnasse station. We planned a day trip to the Mont-Saint-Michel and had to leave from the station in early Morning. The hotel room is clean and spacious. We did walk to Eiffel Tower within less than 20 minutes. The area could be scary to walk during the night. The decoration of the hotel is quite nice and modern. ,"April 6, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

17,"Compared to other Novotels, I felt a more casual atmosphere. The reception area was located on one table and it is located to the south, so it is a little bit away from famous sightseeing places.

19,This is our 3rd visit to paris and this hotel is definitely one of the best we have stayed in. It was in the perfect location for us. The staff are all extremely helpful and friendly and very patient as my french is not very good but i do try. The hotel has tea and coffee facilities in the room as well as a small fridge. The room we had was excellent and cant fault it. Would definitely recommend this hotel and when we come back to paris this will be our 1st choice of hotel we stay in. ,"March 22, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

20,"Really can’t say anything bad about this hotel. Check in was a breeze almost too easy. The rooms were big and spacious and loved the fact that the rooms have a two room bathroom so that families can easier get ready. Breakfast was delicious - lots of different options and he restaurant for lunch and dinner was also really great! Would say this hotel would be perfect for families with children and teenagers. Close to a major train station and also has tons of soft spaces throughout the hotel to watch movies, lounge, play games. Was really awesome!

23,"I stayed four nights for a business trip. The check-in was quick, and I managed to get a room even though I arrived at 9am. Room was spacious and had a beautiful picture of a red fox in the snow. Bed was comfortable and the breakfast was adequate spread. Only issue I had was I kept having trouble with my card to gain access to the lift to bring me to my room.

24,"Me and my SO stayed here for 4 nights. It’s a great atmosphere, modern and young. The only negatives would be room having no air conditioning, which in the colder seasons can be remedied with opening the window- and the extra fees that totaled to about 180 euro’s.The food was astounding. The Halle burger is possibly the best burger I’ve ever had, and on multiple occasions my SO got the side of mash potatoes. I believe every night they have a dj come in to do some live mixing over their stereo (which in my opinion adds to the atmosphere.) We saw men in business meetings, families old and young, and couples like us- they can take care of everyone.The staff was good too- I would come back to this hotel just for the bartender Abdool, he remembered our orders, and took care of anything we needed with a smile. TLDR: Clean, nice atmosphere, good staff, good food. I wish I knew what kind of chips they had at the bar so I can get a bag or two. ","February 17, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

26,"The room was small (whey you come with three suitcases and two carry on as you are traveling from North America to ski resort and you are doing a stop over in Paris), but we didn't mind it at all as we spent the least time in the hotel. The beds are very comfy and we loved that the spare sofa bad is separated in two separate single beds - great for kids to sleep and not argue and those were a real beds too. Room was maintained very clean and staff is friendly. We were lucky that our room was ready when we arrived around 12, and at checkout we could leave our baggage in secured lockers. Really nice feature that they have, have not seen it in other hotels. Location is great, very close to train, metro or bus and easy to get to every major attraction. There is a supermarket within 3 min walk and a huge shopping center within 5 min walk.","February 3, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

Breakfast is complete, but was extremely busy so we had to wait each day to be seated.roomservice and bar were very good too.Parking is very very tight. Tip for improvement, make housekeeping take the leftovers from the room-service from the room when they make the beds. it's not very nice to return in a smelly room with french fries standing on the cupboard all day.","January 2, 2019","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

30,After 3 weeks travelling Europe this is my first review with anything negative to say. The hotel is in a great location and the room we had was a good size for 4 of us and very clean. Bathroom was great. Loved the shower. Negatives Why disposable cups for coffee? If you provide an espresso machine you can supply proper cups Gym was closed which was disappointing But the biggest problem was the aircon. With 4 of us in a small room we woke up sweating the first night. Was stifling. Adjusted the second night and same result. Spoke to reception who advised my husband the air conditioning doesn’t work during winter. Why? You still need fresh air and should be able to control the temperature in your room. Beds were great but no one had a good nights sleep as it was hot and stuffy,"December 31, 2018","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

33,"Booked the hotel for two nights without breakfast. On second night, while requesting the front desk to assist in booking a taxi for the next morning, I casually asked if breakfast was actually included in my hotel booking. To my surprise I was told breakfast was included, even though I asked her to check again. Thinking that since breakfast was already included (and we had already missed the first breakfast), my family proceeded to consume the breakfast the next morning. I used the fast checkout service. Imagine my surprise to find that in the subsequent bill sent to me by email, I was charged for 2 sets of breakfast even though 1) we were told the booking had included breakfast 2) we had only consume one.I had written to the email address: H5060@accor.com to dispute the charges, but I had not received any response after 2 weeks.","December 6, 2018","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

34,"I, together with my entire family, have had the worst experience ever at NOVOTEL PARIS CENTRE GARE MONTPARNASSE.1) FRONT DESK MANAGER WAS EXTREMELY RUDE, His name is Fabrice, in fact he was extremely insolent, I question how Accor HR did their work on him before engaging his service.2) I had called the front desk to ask about the sofa bed, Fabrice just cut short the line and said ""Yes, a staff will be there"" without listening much to the issue and hung up the phone.3) Upon Checking out, Fabrice insinuated that my wife and I were trying to short change the hotel for 2 beers. He even threw the invoice across to me over the small table which he could have just passed it to me by hand.4) An additional note: At Check out, he asked for my room card, and I told him I had left it on the table in the room. He told me to go get it. I have NEVER ONCE been asked to retrieve a room card. I am an ACCOR GOLD and my Business partner holds a Platinum Level, and I checked with him and he said leaving room cards are NEVER an issue.5) His attitude is UNBECOMING of a representative staff of ACCOR and for this, I expect actions to be taken and I want an update, even from C level personnels.6) House Keeping Staff - Pretends to act like they don't understand or speak english. Trust me, they all do. I requested for an additional towel, and he said to me"" I don't speak english"" in ENGLISH.Should anyone wish to stay at this location, please do not spoil the potential ACCOR experience by getting served by Fabrice, look for Karima who is and was VERY ATTENTIVE.ONCE AGAIN, if there are other options for travellers to stay at other locations, please do so, and avoid this location due to bad front desk staff and house keeping staff.","December 2, 2018","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

36,"All in all a nice hotel. Everywhere was immaculately clean and staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was perfect and the children particularly loved making their own eggs then amusing themselves with the photo booth (excellent touch!). The bar/lobby on an evening had a lovely feel and we sat there and nursed our weary feet from the days walking, with some nice drinks and tunes played by the DJ! Location is about 35 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower but a 5 minute walk to the Metro, we did both and had no issues. A nice safe feeling area. There are only a few niggles, nothing too important, but for me travelling with children that I would consider. First is that the room size was okay...if we'd been there for more than 3 nights it would probably have become an issue as we had to squeeze past each other (our children are 10 and 8) and once the childrens beds were made, there was minimal space. The water in the shower really was not hot (and I like a hot shower)...luke warm we all agreed. And lastly is the lack of mattress protector which for me personally I find a little unhygienic in a hotel, but maybe that is just my thoughts! However all in all a good hotel which I would recommend for a stay in Paris.","November 19, 2018","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

39,"Stayed here, family of four (2 older teenagers) for 3 nights, two rooms neighbouring.Very good location, an easy 10 minute stroll from Pasteur metro, pleasant area. Our rooms were very comfortable, great walk in shower, memory foam mattress and lots of good quality pillows. Our rooms were sparkly clean on arrival and each day on return from our explorations of Paris. We considered the buffet breakfast to be delicious although more than we might usually pay. Each morning the queues for breakfast snaked through the small reception/bar area so on our last morning we got up early(7.45) and avoided this!","November 4, 2018","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

40,"Stayed here for five nights during the Ryder Cup. The hotel location is good, right near Gare Montparnasse, and if you're up to it you can walk to the Eiffel Tower. (This is not a stroll, though. It's a serious walk.) The Metro is also not far away, so you have a number of transportation options.In general, the hotel was fine. The room was adequate in size though not spacious. We were here during a very busy event, and perhaps some of the strain showed. The reception area seemed poorly designed, particularly when more than a couple of people needed attention (checking in, checking out, checking on something). The staff, while friendly enough and eager to help (our check-in clerk was excellent), didn't seem to know how to manage a crowd that exceeded the number of individual stations. Other little things suggested that maybe the hotel was not at its finest during our stay. For example, our key cards would not work on our second day. When we went to the desk to have them recharged, we were soon joined by a long queue of people with the same issue. And our next-to-last day there, our room was not serviced at all. It's not as if they skipped the room entirely. The window was opened, so someone had clearly been in the room, but not a bit of housekeeping had been done. This isn't a crisis--we can sleep in an unmade bed and reuse towels--but it's still not what one expects from a good hotel.The breakfast was plentiful--basically an English breakfast with some other options. I don't know if that is their usual breakfast or was put on specially for the large number of visitors from the UK. In any event, there was enough of it for a tasty, hearty start to the morning. So while there are no major things to complain about, the kinds of little things mentioned here add up to a review of ""average""--better than some we have stayed at in Paris, not as nice as others.","November 3, 2018","0    Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse

42,The hotel is well located with most of the city attractions reasonably close. Rooms are basic but comfortable. Only one bottle of water in the fridge wasn’t adequate for two of us on a four night stay and the tea/coffee facility offered only paper cups.

44,"4-Star hotel with helpful staff, great breakfast and good rooms. We had a pair of adjoining superior rooms which was perfect for our family of 4 - with minibar included in the price. Each room has a queen plus a convertible couch so each could sleep 3 at a pinch, better if the 3rd person is small though!If you haven’t thought of Montparnasse it’s actually not a bad place to stay...walk to the Eiffel Tower, Les Invalides, Montparnasse Tower and the Catacombs; museum of modern art plus lots of theatres, cinemas, shops and of course food - cafes and bakeries everywhere. Just opposite the hotel is a great little cafe that became our local - you need to wait for a table at lunchtime but it’s worth it. The hotel restaurant - Halle Quatre - is pretty good too and the shopping in the area surrounding the Montparnasse Tower is worth the 15-minute walk.

48,We stayed here for one night on our way to Eurocamp in Brittany. The hotel is approx 10 minute walk from Montparnasse train station and there’s a metro station approx 5 minute walk away which made it easy for us to visit the Eiffel Tower. The hotel is modern and clean. I’d say it’s a 4 star hotel and I would have given it 4 stars however when we returned to our room in the evening after a day of sightseeing I went to make myself a cup of tea. To my surprise the cups provided in the bedroom were tiny paper cups.(photo provided) I called reception to ask for a proper cup and was passed through to the bar. I was told by a very rude man that he was busy serving food & drink & I could come to the bar to get one myself. I told the man I wouldn’t be going down to the bar at 10.30 at night as I had children in the room with me. Reluctantly he sent someone up with 2 cups.

63,"I stayed here about five or so years ago during a five day trip with my twin sister and we still talk about it all the time. What is it about the place that's so special, you ask? Well, I'll tell you:1) The rooms are so beautifully and eclectically decorated and are so comfortable and cozy you forget you're renting a room. Ok, actually that's not entirely true--I think les3chambres may be more comfortable than my own home. Also the bathrooms are wonderful--they even have towel warmers!2) The breakfasts. When we were there, Laurent painstakingly prepared us breakfast every morning. Perhaps the best coffee I've ever had--I still judge coffee against it. Definitely the best croissants and bread I've ever had--Laurent gets it fresh everyday. When we got back to the States we immediately went out for coffee and croissants because we missed them so much from Laurent and, well, were sorely disappointed in the quality. Maybe it's better this way--saves me from myself. Then Laurent prepares some special treat everyday. I believe we had an apricot tart one day and other yummy baked goods the others. The yogurt is amazing, the granola, the fresh fruit, the little details like the honey Laurent had gotten in Greece... It goes on.3) The location. You're far enough from the hustle and bustle to feel relaxed and like you're on vacation, but close enough to walk to most of the attractions you'd want to see. We loved this area.4) The hosts. Laurent and Bernard were wonderful hosts and constantly available to provide recommendations, call and make us dinner reservations, arrange a car to the airport etc. It felt more like we were with family than in a b&b. Laurent suggested things we never would have known about--for example, a fireworks show right out of the city that was timed to popular music and special for that time of year. It was incredible and we were so glad we went. He also suggested (and booked) nearby restaurants like Albion and Richer which were very local feeling and WONDERFUL. In sum: I was inspired to write this review sitting in a coffee shop in San Francisco... With a subpar coffee and croissant that made me miss les3chambres yet again five years later. It really was a perfect stay.","April 12, 2019","1    Les3chambres

It has a coffee maker, water, a closet for your coats, a TV, a safe, private bathroom and toilet (with the most amazing hand soap and shampoo) and probably stuff I forget to list right now. The bed itself is just amazing. My very stressed out partner was able to have a GREAT night's sleep, and me too. I really need to know the brand of the bed and mattress. (Upon making this review, the host contacted me by e-mail in order to inform me of the brand and model.) Upon waking up, we were served with a great breakfast, including home-made jam, juice, croissants and coffee. Thanks to the host's friendliness, graciousness, and tips we were able to enjoy Paris even during a weekend that saw violent protests once more. The host had expert advice on which areas to avoid, and as a result we have not witnessed any violence or protests. This is definitely a property which we will revisit in the future.

76,Recently stayed at Laurent's beautiful home for a long weekend break. Everything about Les3Chambres made for a memorable time - from the wonderful ambiance to Laurent who is an amazing host who goes the extra mile to deliver exemplary customer service. A truly exceptional place and fully deserving of its rating. Ideally situated for easy access to all the sights with the breakfasts being a particular highlight. ,"December 3, 2018","1    Les3chambres

77,"My wife and I spent 5 wonderful nights at Les3chambres in early October 2018 and we could not have been happier. Upon our arrival we were greeted very warmly by the owner Laurent. Les3chambres is the apartment where Laurent lives and shares the three guest rooms as part of the B&B. We stayed in La2Chambre 2 which was beautiful, spacious and quiet. We were blown away each morning by Laurent's delicious traditional French breakfasts which include amazing baguettes and croissants fresh from the patisserie, fresh homemade baked cakes, homemade jams, fresh fruit, juice and coffee. Laurent pays attention to the little things in this B&B that make it stand above the rest such as his special map of Paris that highlights the various neighborhood, tourist stops and places to eat. We highly recommend Les3chambres and will certainly plan to stay here once again when we return to Paris.","November 29, 2018","1    Les3chambres

All are of the same level of quality and amenities, they are just different in colours and size. French breakfast delicious as always with fresh products, like ""les financiers"" as my favourite this time. Many restaurants and things to do in the vicinity and from metro stop Cadet at a 2-minute walk you can reach the rest of Paris.

The rooms were clean and comfortable, with nice touches like bottled water and Aesop shampoo and body wash. The details were thoughtful – We were provided with a map of the surrounding area with restaurant recommendations and walking guides. Les3Chambres is well within walking distance to major attractions and must-see neighbourhoods like Montmartre. The breakfast was a highlight too – From the fresh croissants to the homemade sweets.

No detail is spared, from a delicious homemade breakfast, the beautifully decorated apartment, to any and all advice from a gracious host. The apartment is well situated within walking distance to all major attractions. We fell in love with Montmartre, which is only a 10 minute walk.

It's location makes it very easy to get to all the top tourist sights, plus Laurent's map of special Paris walks, which highlights museums, restaurants and coffee houses along that walk, is an invaluable resource.

Laurent’s apartment is an elegant, welcoming retreat and he is a gracious and thoughtful host. We stayed in Chambre #1 and had plenty of room (especially by Paris standards!) Bed was comfortable, bathroom was luxurious, and breakfasts were delicious, with fresh croissants, baguettes, homemade jams, a special cake every day, fresh fruit, yogurt and homemade granola, and fresh-squeezed juice. Laurent made sure we were introduced to the other guests at breakfast and was always available to answer questions or give suggestions for where to go and what to see. He even provides a customized map that shows 3 great walks you can do from the apartment, his favorite restaurants, cafes, and bakeries, and other attractions. We particularly liked the “covered walkways” walk. One last luxury in Paris-an elevator! I had unexpected knee trouble during our visit and it was helpful to be able to use the elevator up and down the three flights of stairs! We’d definitely recommend Les3chambres if you’re in Paris.

The post office building is on a quiet street and we had no problem finding it with Laurent's instructions. The apartment itself is breathtaking pretty and very well decorated. Laurent took great pride in showing us around his home and our room, number two. The large bed was very comfortable and was dressed with pristine white linens both nights of our stay. There was a great selection of Damman teas and the room was full of really thoughtful touches. The en-suite was immaculate and equipped with a great rainforest shower and hand selected toiletries.Laurent clearly enjoys his work and was more than happy to give us tips and off the beaten path recommendations for us to enjoy over the course of the weekend. He had even produced his own map with a couple of great walking tours.Breakfast at Laurent's was an amazing hand made French breakfast, with croissants, fresh bread, fruit salad, home made granola, home made cakes and all the trimmings; we couldn't have asked for better. The freshly brewed coffee in the morning was a treat.It was all of the little touches that made our stay an absolute pleasure and we will be sure to stay here again next time we come to Paris.

87,"Love at first sight is how you would describe our first visit to Laurent’s beautiful flat in Paris. So a return visit was a must when we decided to come back to France. We have traveled a lot in the last four years but we have yet to find a more charming and knowledgeable host, not to mention his excellent cooking skills. The flat is a testimony to his great taste and all three rooms offer a unique feel for the city. We chose the second for the view of the street - full of city’s sights and sounds (which disappear with the closing of your window!). Laurent’s breakfast is legendary as is his knowledge of the city so be sure to work with him on your itinerary and dining choices. When you leave your heart is heavy and you wish you had more time to stay - a true testament to to Les3chambres.","September 6, 2018","1    Les3chambres

Laurent has created an oasis of luxury and exceptional hospitality in the heart of Paris. He is an incredible host who has thought of everything guests would want and need and he is a lovely gentleman. Read others' reviews about the delicious home-made breakfasts and gorgeous decor. They're all true. The best review I can possibly give to Laurent and Les 3 Chambres is this - don't stay anywhere else in Paris. This is an experience you don't want to miss and one that you will remember for a lifetime. Thank you again, Laurent. I look forward to my next stay.","July 16, 2018","1    Les3chambres

91,"I can wholeheartedly recommend a stay at Les 3 Chambers with Laurent. The apartment is beautifully decorated and our bedroom was sumptuous. Beautiful linens and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Laurent is so thoughtful and provided us with a map of walks around Paris that he had created which was brilliant, we took the covered passages of Paris walk - we probably would never have found them without the map. Breakfast is served in the gorgeous dining room and is a real feast - freshly brewed coffee, croissants and baguettes from the local bakery, home made jams made with fruits from Laurent’s grandmother’s garden, and fresh baked apricot cake. The location of the apartment was perfect - within 20-30 mins you can walk to Montmatre, Marais or down to the Seine.

The breakfasts were exceptional with home made cakes and jams and even homemade granola !

Laurent is your host extraordinaire, private chef, and personal concierge to Paris. He custom built the entire floor of this 19th-century apartment to specifically be a B&B. It's small and cozy but has everything you need - as well as books, maps, and power adapters. The rooms are modern and fresh, the beds are comfy, and breakfast is expertly prepared by Laurent himself. It's a great quiet location between Gare du Nord and Montmartre. I'll let you in on another secret - he could easily charge a lot more for these rooms. Do not hesitate, book it!","May 29, 2018","1    Les3chambres

97,"Due to an expansion of our stay here in Paris we stayed at both The Parister and Les3chambres during our Paris stay, so we got to have both the small hotel and the B&B experience during our visit. Staying at both gave us the opportunity to clearly see the advantages of staying in Laurent's home while enjoying Paris.DININGOnce you get to know the neighborhood you will find that there are very good food options of every type within just an easy walk. It is easy to use apps to find good food options that abound, but with Laurent you have the advantage of having first-hand knowledge of the restaurants, wait times and environment and specialties so that you can make an informed choice. We liked both of the restaurants that we tried from his recommendations (Richer and 52) with 52 having some unexpectedly delicious appetizers.Of course, the nice thing is that you start your day with Laurent's breakfast (so long as you don't have pressing plans that prevent dining from 8-9:30am as we did a few times). It is a beautiful and relaxing way to start the day, and gives you a chance to quiz Laurent on feedback on plans for the day as well as enjoying whatever fresh jams and baked goods he has prepared for the day. Also, if other guests are there for breakfast it makes for a nice opportunity to meet fellow travelers and glean knowledge from them on other opportunities to see and do in Paris and around the world.Laurent will guide you to the absolute best French places, as he is quite the Francophile, but if you want to venture to other cuisines we can highly recommend Muqam for Chinese a very short walk away, and also Le Papacionu for pizza. Make sure on any weekend night to make reservations in advance! Those are also handy on weekdays, but without reservations on weekends you may find yourself with very few options.TRANSPORTThe Cadet station is just around the corner, super simple point to hop the local train and get anywhere in Paris quickly. Gars Nord and Est are also an easy ten minute walk away, and those offer quick access to regional and international destinations. We were there for over a week so we bought a week pass and could easily hop on and off the trains with abandon. Of course walking around Paris is a joy, and Laurent's maps and counsel offer good options for how to explore on foot. Cycling, buses, Uber, taxis also abound. Once you get familiar Paris is very easy to get around and nothing seems very far away.THE ROOMParis is like many cities that are also major tourist destinations (New York City, Florence, etc) in that you can expect small rooms as the norm. The key is to maximize what you have to work with. Our room and bathroom may have been small, but everything we needed was there and the amenities are well thought out. A nice shower with good quality soaps and shampoos, provided USB outlets and a spare converter plug as well as a coffee maker, a small closet space for hanging clothes and big windows for fresh air or natural light. We just had to organize our luggage better and once we did we never missed the big space, we just loved the space we had!I am sure we will come to Paris again because we just love it, and if so staying with Laurent would be our first choice. So do yourself a favor and stay there, but don't book it when Jacque and I want to return!","May 15, 2018","1    Les3chambres

98,"We were excited to arrive at Les3chambres because of the beautiful images we’d seen and the outstanding reviews we’d read. To add our own now is such a pleasure but where to start? Maybe the joy of experiencing Laurent’s beautiful home with its sumptuous furnishings, collection and interesting objets d’arts. Room 2 was perfectly quiet, the bed so soft and comfy, the decorations, linen and toiletries highest quality, like the tea and coffee served at the Parisien breakfast which includes beautifully prepared fruit, homemade granola, bread, croissants and each day, a homemade cake or tart and preserves. Over breakfast, Laurent’s friendly advice on where to go, where to eat and to thereby experience Paris like a local because the area is off the tourist track and residential, yet very central to the different parts of Paris by foot or metro if you prefer. To stay on the Left Bank again was a temptation I’m glad we resisted because now Les3chambres in the 9th feels a bit like home and next time there will be no choice to make. We’ll be back to discover more of this lovely area with your guidance. Merci Laurent. A bientot!","May 2, 2018","1    Les3chambres

99,"My fiancée and I spent this year’s Easter vacation at the les3chambres and had one of our best hotel experiences so far which means a lot, since we are both travelling and staying in hotels quite a lot for work. We also usually never write reviews on TripAdvisor but we were so amazed by Laurent’s wonderful place that we decided to do so this time. So here come the top 3 reasons why you should spend your next stay in Paris at the les3chambres:1) Most beautiful apartment and room we have stayed in so far – with an incredible amount of attention to detailAs soon as you enter Laurent’s apartment you will be overwhelmed by the incredibly tasteful interior of his entire flat. Every room possesses unique décor and so much attention to detail – I especially liked the very tasteful photographs in our room and the high-quality soap (brand Aesoap) in our room. At no point, we had the feeling of staying in a hotel or common B&B, it was rather like “coming home” after a long day of sightseeing in Paris. And by the way, the term “Bed&Breakfast” really falls short to describe Laurent’s place – les3chambres is so much more!2) You will feel like at home in ParisLes3chambres offers the perfect mix between privacy and interaction with an authentic Parisian host. We really enjoyed the breakfasts where Laurent would spend a lot of time helping us to plan our daily sightseeing route and giving tips on amazing restaurants, wine bars and special museum offers. And of course, his amazing breakfast needs to be mentioned here – again with so much attention to detail and high-quality ingredients. In a normal hotel you will never get someone who lets you in on the secret of the Parisian way of living and culture. 3) Ideal location for sightseeing and fine dining in ParisLaurent’s apartment is situated between the 9th and 10th ARR. which is really the ideal location in Paris: All sights can be reached within max. 30 minutes by foot and if you follow the little map Laurent prepared for all his guests you will discover a lot of hidden gems on the way. The area is also full of hip restaurants and authentic Parisian cafes and restaurants – and again, Laurent is very helpful in finding the perfect restaurant for you if you ask him.Summing up, we can absolutely recommend les3chambres and will definitely come back – hopefully sooner than later!","April 8, 2018","1    Les3chambres

101,What a find. This is a truly lovely place to stay - all the facilities of a boutique hotel but with the personality of staying in Laurent's lovely home. Others have commented on his lovely breakfast and home baking - which is fabulous. And his advice and guidance of where to go in Paris is very very welcome. We intend to travel to paris more frequently to explore in greater detail and shall be using Laurent's apartment as our base.When you book with Laurent he suggests you use Eelway if you want to travel in Paris luggage free. This is an excellent service. We left our bag with them at Gare du Nord and spent the day in Paris - to find our bag safely delivered to the apartment. Similarly on the return trip they collected our bag from the apartment and we met them at Gare du Nord. We even managed to change our meeting time via the chat facility during the course of the Sunday. Its not a cheap service (circa €30 each way) but it allowed us to spend two suitcase free days exploring Paris. We never took a taxi - using public transport all the way.Another great recommendation from Laurent,"March 21, 2018","1    Les3chambres

The apartment is great, just as you can see on the images! So much style and taste, there's a lot to see in these rooms and you really feel welcome there just as you step trough the door. The breakfast is even better than expected, great products and so well prepared! The room was super clean & the bed was like a cloud to sleep in - all in all a perfect place to stay when in Paris, we willdefinitely come back!","December 11, 2017","1    Les3chambres

108,"La Chambre Parisienne was elegant, beautifully decorated, clean and smelled lovely. Located in an old house in a silent and safe street, with good access to several stations and the hill of Monmartre and artisan street.The hosts Greg and Bernd were beyond hospitable and treated as like their own guests. Thanks to them, for a short we could experience a bit of careless Parisian life. We got completely spoiled by the best breakfasts, crepes, deserts and dinner with generour amount of wine. (By the way, food adjusted to match my almost vegetarian diet preferences) During this 2 night stay we exchanged conversations, received lots of Paris travel, gourmet advise, interesting insights about local culture and even a private piano performance by Bernd. After our check out Greg packed us tea and a large piece of his own made fruit cake for our return trip home through London.Actually there were so many other moments of kindness and generosity, but this review will get too long. So just go to Paris and experience it all by yourself at La Chambre Parisienne.","May 13, 2019","2    La Chambre Parisienne

Their breakfast was wonderfully over the top and they helped ease the stress of us being in a new city/country for the first time.

Location was fantastic within very easy reach of gare du nord and gare du est plus two minutes from the metro network. It was also within walking distance of the Montemartre district and we even walked from the main city centre. The owners are wonderful and welcomed us into their home, sitting with us over breakfast and in the evening after diner. On the first evening we ordered dinner and it was wonderful home cooked fair. with a flair Gregory is a wonderful cook and makes his own yoghurt and preserves to serve at breakfast too.

The room and bathroom are squeaky clean and the perfect size for two people with a gorgeous view of the courtyard. The bed is insanely comfortable and perfect for rest after a long trip. Their place is also within walking distance of two train stations which makes trips from the airport, around the city and to trains outside of Paris so convenient. Beyond all of the amenities, chatting and having breakfast with Gregory (that he prepared!!) will go down as one of my favorite memories of our trip to Paris.

120,"Our 10 days at La Chambre Parisienne were delightful. First, the accommodations: Grégory and Bernd have a single room for guests in their tastefully furnished apartment on the edge of Montmartre. The double bed is very comfortable, the room has all the gadgets and amenities, and the modern shower is all you could want. Everything is fastidiously clean, and there were flowers in our room when we arrived! The room isn't large, but in the mornings while my wife was still sleeping I was able to use the living room to read and catch up on email without bothering her. WIFI went well. The room is so quiet you that just don’t hear the city sounds, at least not in February. It overlooks an inner courtyard. As American tourists who wanted to go all over Paris, we realized after a couple of days that our location just two blocks from the Barbes Rochechourt Metro station was ideal. From there we could easily get almost anywhere. Grégory and Bernd are ideal hosts and we greatly enjoyed our conversations with them. (Bernd speaks English (and German) fluently while Grégory does very well in English.) My wife especially enjoyed talking about cooking with Grégory, who has culinary training. They gave us excellent restaurant suggestions and Metro tips and didn’t seem annoyed with questions about Paris they must have been asked many times. From the beginning to the end they were attentive and accommodating, never intrusive. Unlike many B&B hosts, they only have one guest room and one set of guests at a time.Our breakfasts were remarkably good, with selections of breads (Grégory went out for croissants and baguettes every morning before breakfast), meats, cheeses, a bowl of fruit, and on some mornings eggs and crepes. It was really more than we generally have for breakfast, but it fortified us for our long days on our feet. We’d go back.","February 26, 2018","2    La Chambre Parisienne

123,"I was tired of the small hotel rooms in Paris and found La Chambre Parisienne on the internet. Great location between Gare du Nord and Montmartre. The booking was made via their website and was very easy and straightforward - even the amendment that I had to make. Communication was great and I even received an email a few days before arrival with details of how to get there etc.We absolutely loved everything about the place, starting with the fabulous hosts, Gregory and Bernd. Nothing was too much trouble. They both have a great knowledge of Paris whether for sightseeing, dining, museums etc. We were even provided with a few Metro tickets to get around.The bedroom is very nice with an extremely comfortable bed and beautiful bedding. A coffee machine is in the room also. Other facilities include bath robes and slippers and quite a variety of toiletries in the en-suite.Guests are invited to use the lounge and it was a pleasant place to get to know Gregory and Bernd over a glass or two of delicious French wine.Breakfast was amazing. The variety of items was huge ranging from smoked salmon, a range of cheeses, cold meats, homemade jams and yogurt, fruit salad and of course a variety of breads. Fantastic.They also offer to prepare evening meals which we had one night. That was mind-boggling. For only 30 euros per person including wine! The food was superb and the setting sensational. Lovely crockery and cutlery etc.We spent 5 nights here and with the welcome that we received and the quality of everything , we were more than happy.Thank you Gregory and Bernd.

From the courtyard to the apartment and the room we stayed in, it is simply stunning!. The room itself is a great size and the bed is soooo comfy.

Sat at the beautiful dinning table with the hosts sharing stories and eating the most delicious foods was a real treat and made our holiday even more special. Both hosts made it so enjoyable that we almost didn't want to go out into Paris!

I really enjoyed their company over lengthy breakfasts in their beautiful dining room. They gave us lots of useful information about things to see and do. They even went as far as to call around restaurants for us on New Year's Eve and ultimately selected somewhere for us which was just perfect. We enjoyed a celebratory glass of champagne together on NYE before heading out to town. They literally could not have done more to enhance our visit to Paris.The apartment itself is beautiful in a typically Parisian way and reminds you of classic French films (high ceilings, parquet flooring, big windows). Our room was super comfortable and had everything you could ask for including a Nespresso machine. The main problem was trying to get out of bed in the mornings - we could have stayed in bed for the entirety of our 4 day stay - it was just so comfortable! The location is ideal too - situated less than 10 mins walk from Gare du Nord, on a quiet street, it enjoys easy access to the central attractions of Paris, as well as being very close to Montmartre. There are a number of Metro stations nearby but to be honest we were able to walk easily to pretty much everywhere.

134,"Previous reviews told us all we needed to know about booking La Chambre Parisienne, so the first thank you must go to all those reviewers, otherwise we would not have just had one of the best stays, if not THE best stay, we have ever had while travelling, and we have had some good ones before. My wife Cheryl and I always prefer the B & B option when travelling rather than impersonal hotels, although this was even a different experience to the usual B & B, as you are simply sharing Bernd and Gregory's apartment with them as they too go about their daily lives. They just give you your own keys to come and go as you wish.Their elegant apartment is situated less than ten minutes walk from Gare du Nord so is very well-placed for anyone arriving on Eurostar, as we did. It is situated in the very charming 9th Arrondisement, about five or six minutes walk from the foot of Montmartre and Sacre Coeur. Metro station of Barbes (Lines 2 & 4) is three minutes walk away. What can we say about Bernd and Gregory!! Just two of the loveliest people we have ever come across, they made us feel at home in their home from the start, and after five nights we reluctantly had to say goodbye yesterday to two people who very quickly came to feel like very old friends. Whilst we saw a lot in Paris and explored some charming neighbourhoods etc. some of our best memories of our stay will simply be the time spent with the two guys and the conversations we all had, mostly over breakfast, which you all have together, or sometimes later in the evenings. We can only summarise by saying they are wonderful company and we began to miss them both greatly from the moment we went out of the door to come home.The quality of the accommodation has been well-documented by many other reviewers and it is as good as anything we have ever experienced. Fantastic bed (with good firm mattress and quality bedding), lovely little en-suite in the room and many nice touches in the room if required, plus plenty of sightseeing literature, maps, eating recommendations etc. to help you on your way.The above-mentioned breakfast chats took place over a wonderful breakfast every morning, which every day left us not really needing anything else until the evening! Hams, cheeses, baguettes, brioches, pastries, home made (by Gregory) jams and yoghurts, juices, teas, coffee, fruit bowl............you get the drift! Even made sure they got Cheryl some decaff coffee as soon as they realised she could not drink non-decaff. The communication from the time of booking was always good and nicely informal, and by the time we arrived at Gare du Nord, to be met by Gregory with a board bearing our names (he also insisted on pulling our suitcase to their apartment!), we almost felt as though we were arriving to stay with friends.If there is anything more I can add to what others have already stated then I'm afraid I can't think what it could be. What I CAN say is that we would not now consider staying anywhere else in Paris should we visit again, and would 100% recommend anyone else to do the same.Bernd and Gregory, thank you so much for a wonderful stay, that will live long in our hearts and memories.Richard and Cheryl (Les Gendarmes des Croissants!!)","September 18, 2016","2    La Chambre Parisienne

141,"I am staying at the Hyatt Regency Etoile this week. As an Explorist Hyatt regular member (including using Hyatt credit card), I was given 4 awards to be used for club access. I thought my Paris stay would be comfortable with the club access but the hotel denied to accept the awards. At the time of check-in, I was asked to call Hyatt member line to get them to inform Hotel for the access. I thought it was a strange request but I made the international call anyway. Then after being called to give access, the hotel denied again stating they were fully booked. While I stayed for 5 days, I only asked for 2 days of access.I still don’t understand why Hyatt gives awards for club access If the hotels don’t actually honor them. It makes me question the alum of the Hyatt loyalty program. It was a disappointing experience and I wasted quite some time and effort in this process. Not what I want to do on my vacation.

143,"The USP of this Parisian behemoth has to be its views - on one side you will take in a sweep bookended by Montmartre, while on the other side you can have La Tour Eiffel (for a price). The rooms have everything - including a safe with condoms! - and, although tight, are actually relatively spacious by Paris standards. In particular I recommend the comfortable beds and the modern bathrooms. The only caveat about this place is that it is not cheap.

146,"Id expect better from a Hyatt Regency but I guess this is Paris after all. This is like a no frills Hyatt with the worst food ever in their so called restaurant Mayo. And get this, I wanted room service the first night I was there. So I looked at the seriously over priced menu but didn't care. I ordered which is usually very tasty a Burger Charleois. So the room service arrived with a paper bag which inside was a burger in a box and a bunch of French fries in a bag. Are you kidding me. For $40! What ever happened to a cart set with a table cloth, a proper dish, accoutrements, etc. Not here are the No Frills Hyatt. Ok the room was great ( but small which is the norm ) very comfy bed, nicely appointed bathroom etc. But my biggest complaint was the lousy and restaurant. Oh and I opted for the Buffet at lunch. Either I was late, or something was up again with a very poorly appointed Buffet for 35E. Dried out chicken, Some fish thing that was mashed up like mashed potatoes, (that's it for the main courses) some limited selection of veggies (try broiled carrots and that's it) some cheese (very average selection) and a selection of some crappy desserts. Honestly what a rip off. I've never stayed at a Hyatt that has such bad food anywhere in my life. Get it together Hyatt.","July 3, 2019","3    Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile

150,"At the front desk, unskilled workers must receive assistance from a more senior factor, checkinqout takes a lot of time. Also they do not speak the truth I asked to eat breakfast at the Mayo resturant on the ground floor because I did not find anything to eat in the lounge on the 31st floor because I do not eat meat and / or pork, and all I wanted was an omelette, I was told that the food was exactly the same as the Mayo restaurant on the ground floor.When I asked to take my bags myself, they insisted that the suitcases reach the room immediately and I have nothing to worry about. I had to wait more than half an hour for the suitcases, which made me late for a very important meeting I had.When I left the hotel, the reception desk should be with six positions when only two are manned.

151,"The hard product is efficient, simple and good. Everything is there. The views are the absolute show stopper here, quite unique as Paris has almost no skyscrapers. The service is good, with attention to detail. However two small points that could be reviewed and worked on: the noise. We sadly had loud neighbours the se one night of our stay and we let the reception desk know. The person that came up could have dealt with this issue in a better way in my opinion. Also, the club lounge is a tiny bit disappointing as the spread/offer is quite limited, especially during the evening. If I come back I may just go for the regular, standard range of rooms. Apart from those two experiences, this is a solid experience and a convenient place.","June 29, 2019","3    Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile

Everything is as you may expect, and it is definitely much better than nr 700 or so at Tripadvisor.

View on the Eiffeltower, think I got lucky, nice bed, good shower, large tv, iron, everything you need. Free bottle of water every day to be picked up at the ground floor, bit strange, but ok.Had breakfast at the club lounge, so cannot comment on the general area, but assuming the choices are the same, it is good, not exceptional.

158,"My husband and I were were booked at this hotel because we were traveling on a Viking River Cruise. It is very modern and don't think we would have chosen it if we were traveling by ourselves. There was a mix of business people, as well as tourists. We found the staff to be extremely kind and helpful. We had a bountiful breakfast buffet in the restaurant every morning. There was also a small cafe that served the most delicious croissants, muffins, sandwiches, coffee, etc. Our room was on a high floor. It was a nice size with king bed, large TV and 120/220 voltage outlets. It was also quiet and we didn't hear any noise from the hallway or from outside. The decor was black and white, which was not to my liking, but that's just my opinion. I wish there had been a mirror over the desk portion so I could have used it while my husband was in the bathroom or vice versa. The large window provided a beautiful view of the city. However, I was disappointed that the view did not include the Eiffel Tower. I would have thought that Viking would have had some clout in providing this. When I approached the Viking representative at the hotel, she said we needed to make that request upon reservation (which we were not aware of, as Viking made our plans). Upon inquiring at the front desk, they said the hotel was sold out of Eiffel Tower views, so we were out of luck. That was the only unfortunate thorn in our otherwise pleasant hotel stay.There was a metro station close by and some nice restaurants that we came upon by walking around. Menus were posted outside.","June 21, 2019","3    Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile

161,"I was undecided if I should rate this 3 or 4 stars. But 4 is for clean rooms (my biggest priority), view and if I could add a second rating it would be 3 stars for the hotel’s overall customer conceptHotel is located about 20-30 mins taxi ride (cost €17) from Paris Gare du Nord train station (Eurostar). Otherwise you could also take a bus #43 in front of the train station and alight at Général Koenig stop just outside of the hotel. The location of this hotel is about 10 mins walk to Arc du Triomph and 30 min walk to Eiffel Tower. Some good points:- Rooms are a lil bit on the small side and cramped but we managed ok with a sofa bed turned into kids bed. We had the room facing the Eiffel Tower, even though it cost more - the view is worth it especially during sunrise, sunset and when the tower lights up sparkling. - buffet breakfast at the lobby has a very good spread including gluten free options- we were greeted by a Chinese staff name Alice who assisted us in our check in process. She was delightful to meet as first timers in Paris and the hotel. She definitely set a good first impressions for us and I hope she gets noticed as I didn’t not managed to meet her and say goodbye when I checked out. - if you need snacks, there’s a supermarket adjacent mall which is very useful for us considering we had a 7yo and needed some snacks. Some improvements / oddities in this hotel which I still can’t grasp the concept til today:- this is not a ‘cheap’ hotel by any means but yet I can’t help feel as if the concept of the hotel was made to feel as if it’s a cheap hotel. - you get a bottle of water everyday via a coupon and you need to retrieve the water from the little shop at the lobby. I have no issues with it although I found it strange they would make you exchange a coupon for a bottle of water when they could have just left the bottles in the room like all other hotels? So if you are staying 5 days alone, you get 5 coupons. Of course you can retrieve entire 5 bottles at one go. Btw these are small bottle of Evian water, one which you can gulp in one go. Surely at a rate we pay, at least 2 bottles per person a day can be given considering the size of the bottle?- if you want ice, you need to go to lobby shop to get because they won’t send it up. - “guest services” button on the phone was weird. I called enquiring bout ice as mentioned above, only to be told quite curtly before the person ended the call without saying anything further - “you need to dial 1 for this” - uhm, isn’t that what “guest services” call is for or am I missing something?- if you ordered food via the lobby shop (eg sandwiches), they charge you for delivery to your room - yes you get charged!- I highlighted this to front desk - the shower drainage is really poor. Not sure if it’s just our room but the water can’t drain fast enough and as a result the water rises up and overflows onto the floor outside. ","June 17, 2019","3    Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile

Our question was refused saying that they don’t do that!! The given alternative was to see with the hotel coffee shop and they could prepare us a box for 9€. I don’t understand why should I pay 9€ when already I’ve paid 25€ for a breakfast that I couldn’t have by any means.

Room had a great view of eiffel tower. Location is ok with some restaurants that also catch the conference crowd. Nice concierge and front desk staff.

They impressed us even before our trip by reaching and asking if we needed anything special.We got there and the entry was clean and the front desk clearly marked. We were able to find the world of hyatt desk easily and got checked in. The VIP manager (Keiko) warmly greeted us and gave us a special gift (much appreciated!).The room was modern and the bed larger than I've seen in many other euro hotels. We were especially impressed with the layout of the bathroom which was large and easily accessible. The room also had many outlets which we were very happy with.We checked out both the hyatt lounge as well as the bar on the 34th floor which had amazing views of the Eiffel tower. Both were clean and easy to navigate.Overall this hotel made us feel special and treated us with class. The staff were friendly and the hotel seemed well run.

185,"We stayed 2 days at the Hyatt regency, a luxury hotel in a big building Porte Maillot, during a short romantic visit in Paris. The room was quite nice and well equiped,. However we have been surprised by 2 indelicate situations. First, we had to claim a bottle of spring water at a store with a ticket rather than having it directly at our disposal in the room. Second, the access to the bar at the 34 floor where we would have liked to share a cocktail, was prohibited by unfriendly staff. We have been asked to wait in the corridor, close tot the entrance while there was a lot of free places in the bar, waiting to a waitress who didn't showed up, while the waiting queue stretched...Such rudeness is not expected in a hotel of that standing..","May 11, 2019","3    Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile

The airport bus stops right infront of the hotel which makes it easier to get to and back from the airport without having to hop on the metro and change different lines.

We love this location: one block away from the metro, and so many great restaurants close by. There is a great local french bakery about 6 mins walk as you head towards the Arc . we went there almost every morning for our croissants and super reasonable compare to the prices we pay in Calif! Love the service at the hotel- front desk check in went fast, concierge were super helpful (we were planning to do a one day visit to Belgium on May 1st but was inform that it was a national holiday there so most shops would be close ). No complains on the level of cleanliness from housekeeping from my room , but our friend did mentioned that when their hot cups were used for coffee in the room, it was not replaced until they had to ask for it. we didn't have that problem in our room. we would definitely stay at this hotel when we visit Paris again!

They have a kitchen which can be used by the guests. It might just be the best budget hotel in Paris. Very well connected with Metro station and lots of eating places around.

Not easy when the bag is 30kgNo breakfast available. There was a common area where you can put your own food in a shared fridge in you wanted.

The hotel is centrally located and has a metro station in close proximity. The room was spotless, quiet and even had air conditioning. The shower reached a good pressure and was also a decent size. The blinds well and truly blacked out the room at night so for those who like it pitch black you will be happy. There hotel doesn’t offer breakfast which didn’t bother us as being in a city we like to explore places to eat anyway but I’m guessing this is the only reason the hotel isn’t ranked higher than 2 star because it’s easily 4 star in every other way.

I gave plenty of notice with my request but put me on 1st floor, (hotel only have 5 floors) with poor internet connection, it won't even accept the password given to me. He told me specifically which internet to connect and only find out from the owner and other guests that I can connect with better line. He even blamed me that it was my phone and told me that am the only one complaining with the internet. Really? I have been travelling and no issues with my internet in other countries I've been to. Didn't even offer to help me to the lift with my luggages. Then transferred me on the following morning with no notice. Then the owner (Samir) tried to make it up by telling me I can move again only for the last 2 nights on the higher floor. I declined as they should have given my request from the start as I made the reservations more than 2 months before my arrival. They tried to make it up to me by giving me free drinks (softdrinks and water). I kept saying no as I bought my own bottles of water during my stay but insisted. They should notify you if your request can not be granted before your arrival.The rooms are very small but clean. you will have to lay your suitcase on the floor.

You could open the windows for fresh air, and if you wanted to sleep in the windows had an electronic shade that could be lowered to block out light. The location was great, right off of the Place de Clichy which had restaurants and a metro station. Moulin Rouge area was a short walk away. There was even a little grocery store across the street where you could buy prepared sandwiches and other food and drinks -- a couple of days we ate dinner early while out sightseeing, and then ended up heading over to the market later in the evening when we got hungry.

Five minutes bus ride to Anvers (Sacre Couer) and about 30 minutes bus ride to Tour Eiffel during rush hour. Number 30 bus comes every 8 minutes during day time. I prefer not taking the close-by metro because it is more interesting taking bus. Restaurant and bakery are everywhere and a few of them close at 2am. Not so good for early bird because place not open at least 7am but it is understandable for the late closing.The real gem of the hotel is their staff and they were so helpful, gave us lot of tourist tips in Paris. Big applause for Zion (day staff), Samir (night staff), Khalifa (morning staff). We learned a lot even we did not talk for long.This is a budgetary two-star hotel in Paris and everything were as expected. It wouldn't be fair to compare to a 3 or 4-star hotel. Having boiling drinking water was so convenience because of the shared kitchen. The 24 hours complementary nescafe alike coffee and tea were great. Cell phone signal and wifi in the hotel can be spotty. Our jacket and backpack got pick pocketed while having dinning in the restaurant close-by. They guy sit behind us pretended to be fixing his long jacket while he went through our stuff instead. We did not lose much because we put the valuable and passport in the hotel safe.

213,"Full disclosure, I never actually stayed at this hotel. However, I did almost arrange for my family to stay at this hotel. I am getting married in June and anyone who lives abroad and has family come from abroad will tell you that helping your family members find a hotel to stay in can be a hassle. This is especially so when you are forced to get married in high tourist season. During that time, things get very expensive. It can be hard to find flights and hotels and as I want my family to share my magical moment with me, I have been helping them to find affordable flights and hotels. I have a habit of going to visit 2 star hotels, which everybody should do. In France, 2 star hotels are not oblige to have air conditioning. Rooms can be insanely small and sometimes dirty. I want to check it out so I went today. I went to the Front Desk and explained my situation to the wonderful man who was working there. His name was Zian, I believe that is how you spell it. I'm sorry if I spelled it wrong. He was amazing! I had called previously and he remembered me after I explained my situation. I asked him if I could see a room and he gave me a small tour of the hotel and showed me two rooms including one that had a view of the terrace below. From what I saw, the hotel is magnificent for a two star. The showers are spacious. The beds look comfy. The place is clean and it has air conditioning, which is RARE for 2 star hotels. Before I left, Zian explained all of the options that I had to reserve for my family. He gave me his contact information so I could follow up with him and offered me a coffee. He is a true professional. If I ever have an opportunity to send somebody to this hotel or stay there, I will do it in a heartbeat. My family decided to go with another hotel, but I didn't want Zian and this hotel to go unnoticed, so I came to Trip Advisor. Zian, Thank you so much for the tour and the coffee! I am so sorry that my family chose another hotel. I will be sending people your way though!","February 26, 2019","4    Hotel Darcet

Although breakfast is not provided there is an area set aside with tables and chairs across from the reception where tea and coffee were available all day and there were plenty of places to buy breakfast nearby. We were also given bottled water on arrival. There is a small communal kitchen where we could heat up food, boil the kettle and leave food in the fridge. Very handy indeed.Our room was on the 4th floor and we tended to use the lift as we were exhausted by sightseeing all day. The lift was very small and only accommodated two people at a time so at times there was a bit of a wait. Had we been fitter we would have walked. We would leave for the day early and would come back at about 5pm for a rest but often found that our room had not been cleaned by then so either went out again or sat in the communal area with a tea or coffee. The room was a good size and well heated ( it was February and very cold outside), comfy bed, lots of coat-hangers in the wardrobe,safe (also in wardrobe), TV and electric blind on the window. We slept well and heard virtually no noise although our room was next to the lift. Good shower with toiletries ( wall mounted dispensers) and a hairdryer ( again wall mounted).In fact everything you would need for a stay in Paris without breaking the budget.","February 10, 2019","4    Hotel Darcet

216,"I was very happy to have taken my fellow tripadvisors' advice. Having a free night in Paris before being tied to a more expensive option, I was delighted with Hotel Darcet. I was early for check-in but was offered coffee in the small but effective off-lobby area. Whilst waiting was very impressed with the receptionist dealing with fellow guests in the most helpful manner. When shown my room I was delighted with a spacious and spotlessly clean room with an extremely comfortable mattress. I had an excellent undisturbed night (very efficient double glazing) and a great shower. The hotel does not offer breakfast (fine by me since I rarely take breakfast) but you are directed to good looking bakery opposite and it is in an area with all sorts of eating options including well-stocked supermarkets. Close to Metro, this hotel has no frills but is ideal for a traveller such as myself who just wants basic cleanliness, comfort and a very warm helpful welcome. Couldn't ask for more.","January 27, 2019","4    Hotel Darcet

The staff are friendly and helpful. And the room doors had a feature that should be standard on every hotel door in the world, but is hardly ever seen - they close slowly and so they're very difficult to slam shut.

There is a tiny elevator (for two people only) but the stairs are more than manageable. Our room was spotlessly clean and was made up each day. We were also pleasantly surprised by the size of the room - there was plenty of space. Even though there was no fridge in the room - all guests have access to a kitchen with a fridge on the ground floor. Location wise, the hotel is about 20 minutes to the Sacre Coeur and it’s only a few minutes walk from the Place de Clichy metro station.

(James Bún a favorite of ours) Convenient to Metro, bus and walking distance to Montmartre. No breakfast but recommend boulangerie down Boul des Batignolles (not Julien but another block or two down). Bring it back to the break room to eat with coffee at the hotel. Nice small market around the corner as well. Hotel also offers a kitchen for use with fridge to store your food should you so desire. Staff were all very friendly & helpful. Excellent value.

257,"Located abut 100 metres from the Arc, this lovely little hotel is the perfect play to stay in Paris. One street back from the Champs Elseyee, it was still very quiet in the evening but close by to a number of restaurants and bars. Staff were friendly and attentive. Breakfast was very bust if you didn't get there first thing. The shower had a huge rain head and was very good in pressure and temperature. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Was terrific.","April 29, 2019","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

258,"I took my 13 year old granddaughter to Paris during her spring break. After researching on TripAdvisor for a hotel, I chose Hotel Cecilia because of the positive reviews. We were not disappointed . The location is 2 streets from the Arc deTriomphe and Champs E’lysees and is also conveniently close to the metro and bus. This boutique hotel was charming and old world French. The room and bathroom were new and immaculate. We had a beautiful view from our balcony of the Arc.Breakfast was plentiful and had a typical Europeanselection. All services were excellent with Lucy being particularly helpful planning each day’s excursion.The price was fair for such a great location.Samir was helpful with our plans as I emailed with him before our trip.A special note about a ”find” during our stay. Around the corner on Avenue Carnot is a small restaurant L’Arc Food. It has a few tables and a LARGE menu of sandwiches, burgers, salads, pizza, crepes... and much more. Food is excellent and there is a young staff who opened this restaurant 2 years ago. Try it - you’ll love it!","April 28, 2019","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

The rooms are small and basic but very clean and the shower was wonderful! The breakfast is self service continental style. I took my own almond butter and almond milk because there wasn’t an option for vegan. The room service menu also has no vegan options.However you’re in Paris there are literally millions of places to eat!

266,"I stayed here with my boyfriend Sept 30 - Oct 2. Mind you, we are Americans. And in AMERICA, if you stay at a hotel and put the Do Not Disturb sign up, that usually is a hint to housekeeping that we don't want you coming into our room. So I left some of my items out thinking they would be safe. WRONG!!! I had wrapped my retainers up and put them NEXT TO my contact lens case. When I came home from a long day out, I came to find the room had been cleaned and my retainers TOSSED! I confronted management about it and all they did was send me to a DEAD END of a company who takes care of their liability insurance. This BS company said that they would not consider MY LOSS as ANY LIABILITY AT ALL. It's not my fault some dumb employee didn't KNOW ANY BETTER and thought my retainers were TRASH! They were next to something that wasn't TRASH and YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WORST PLACE EVER. WORST SERVICE EVER. They are ABSOLUTELY REFUSING to pay ANY AMOUNT OR OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKE. They were NOT supposed to COME IN IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN THE SIGN SAID DO NOT DISTURB. Now, I have to pay close to $1000 OUT OF POCKET to get a new set of retainers.

268,Our recent stay was so bad that I had to go back to check the reviews because this couldn't possibly be the same hotel! The entire street and all transportation was being shut down the next day for Armistice Day. We were informed of this after check in. When we asked the front desk person how we could get to the airport for our flight she said she didn't know. She offered no assistance with our situation. I have never had someone in the hospitality be so dismissive. Hours later we emailed the hotel and someone arranged a car hire that we would meet several blocks away. When we returned from dinner we asked the front desk where do we meet this car and what the name of the service was. He said ask in the morning. We were in disbelief that he won't answer such a simple question. In addition to the rude employees the walls were paper thin. We could clearly hear every word of the phone conservation in the room next to us. An email that we sent to the hotel that addressed our problems and concerns to this day has not been answered. We certainly won't be back to this hotel and do not recommend it to others.,"November 13, 2018","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

275,"This hotel was ideal for our weekend in Paris. Great location that was right beside the Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, but on a quieter street so you really don't realise how close you are! (There was double glazing on our balcony door too which definitely helps) Very boutique-like lounge/breakfast area that has a bar and piano with lovely comfy chairs. Unfortunately we didn't see anyone play during our stay -that really would have made it 5*!Room was spotless and had everything we needed. Shower was excellent. Reception is 24hr so doesn't matter when you arrive or leave which is always great to know.Breakfast was really good, lots of pasties, yoghurt, fruit, ham and cheese so something everyone! The only downside, and a small one at that, is the keys to the rooms are quite fiddly so can be a little noisy to enter and leave. But other than I really recommend for a comfortable stay that is in a great location. Good value for money.","August 27, 2018","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

277,"I just got back from a five days stay at this hotel, and I cant say enough good things about it. A beautiful little place, classically furnished and decorated, in a nice building close to the Arc De Triomphe. The room we stayed at wasn't so little as I expected after reading about Paris hotels, the bathroom was spacious with two sinks (his-and-her) and even a bathtub. There was an air dryer in the bathroom (no mini fridge in the room though). The room had air-conditioning (which was crucial at the time of our visit) and a small balcony overlooking the Arc De Triomphe. This leads me to the biggest advantage of the hotel - the location. Five minutes walk to and from a central metro line, five minutes from the direct bus stop that takes you to and from the airport, ten minutes to the Champs Elysees. Being so close to the Arc made it so easy to locate and to reach. The area is full of shops, restaurants and cafes. Though our room was facing the street and giving us a lovely view of the Arc, no noises came through when the window was closed. The staff was very kind, answering all our questions and willing to assist in whatever we needed, especially a blond lady at reception whose name I unfortunately don't know. And though our reservation through a booking agency said it was ""room only"" and no breakfast, it was actually included in the price. We enjoyed a selection of bread and pastry, cheese, sausages, yogurts and cereals. The hotel was key to my good time in Paris and I would most definitely go back when I visit the city again.

The best part of this hotel is the location. It's just a block or two from the Arc de Triomphe. Ther metro is less than a five minute walk and that's the best way to get around Paris.

Close proximity to the 'Le Bus' (used to be 'Les Cars') stop for airport transfers; excellent restaurants nearby; spectacular views of the Arc de Triomphe and a floodlit Eiffel Tower - all real plus points.Then there is the hotel itself. We have always found it very quiet, despite the prime location, and always sleep well in its comfortable beds. Rooms are a good size, with fresh décor and immaculate housekeeping. Breakfast is a continental buffet, not elaborate, but everything is of good quality (bread, pastries and fresh fruit salad exceptional), pots of tea or coffee are brought to your table, and buffet items are regularly and quickly topped up so everything is very fresh.Finally, all staff are welcoming and efficient, and seem to take pleasure in ensuring that your stay is a happy one.We shall certainly be back!","March 11, 2018","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

296,"Stayed here for three nights to explore Paris before returning home, and I will never stay any where else in Paris! (I actually just booked our next stay, and panicked when Expedia said they were sold out for Bastille Day. Emailed the hotel and got lucky that there was availability for a family room!!)The room for this trip was a standard room with a double bed (no kids with us for this trip). The room was pretty basic, but was very clean and comfortable. Had a balcony with a view of the courtyard. The room was also a decent size for being in Paris.The breakfast was fresh and very tasty. Staff was very attentive, and brought coffee refills before we even ran out. Excellent service. The hotel staff was also incredibly friendly, and although I speak some French, they spoke English as well, which was helpful when I struggled. One of the best aspects of this hotel was the location!!! Right down the street from the Arc de Triomphe, literally, and close to the train, buses, taxis, etc. Also close enough to walk to the Eiffle Tower if you don't mind a 30 minute stroll with some awesome shops and cafes along the way.Last, but not least, the price for what you get can't be beat! I love this hotel so much, I was hesitant to review it because I don't want it to get too popular.. I might not be able to reserve a room next time!! Thank you for the amazing stay Hotel Cecilia! :)","March 9, 2018","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

297,"I stayed one night at Hotel Cecilia. There was some refurbishment going on but since I was only there for the night it was fine. Great location. The room that I stayed (no. 18) simple, clean line, comfortable bed and good size considered the location. Breakfast was continental style, so not hot breakfast. The only thing I would say was the shower water pressure was a bit low but again it was fine. Overall a pleasant stay. ","January 25, 2018","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

300,"I have chosen Hotel Cecilia mainly because of the ideal location to the conference venue where I was on business, but close proximity to Arc De Triomphe makes it an ideal location for everyone. The hotel is located on one of the quieter avenues, but offers short 2 min walk to the Arc and about 30 min walk to the Seine and Eiffel Tower.The hotel itself is quiet, single room I booked offered surprisingly enough space and decent size clean and rather modern bathroom. The room itself was rather simple but clean, although it had a slight odor which I had to minimize with a scented candle. Hotel offers good continental breakfast with good choice of cold cuts, cheese and pastries, fresh fruits and juices of course.Hotel staff is very nice, always ready to help. You are asked to leave your keys at the hotel desk if you are not in, which some of my friends found strange, but I have seen this before.Overall, excellent location and value for the money spent.","November 6, 2017","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

Good breakfast. Poor housekeeping one morning but this was corrected promptly. A/C went out but portable unit was supplied and it was fixed the next day. Only problem was the elevator went out the 2nd day and was still out four days later when we left. I would definitely stay here again. A little far away from the old city but good access to metro.

307,"What I liked about this hotel:1. Location. It is only a few minutes from Etoile and also a few minutes from the bus stop to and from both CDG and Orly airports. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to the Congress Centre and therefore convenient for those who attend a conference there. Needless to say, a metro station is also a few minutes away. The area is safe and pleasant. 2. Room. I had a room 54 on the 5th floor with a small terrace and a view on the street (with a part of the Arc de Triomphe also visible). The room was very spacious (also the bathroom!), especially taking into account the standards of the Parisian 3-star hotel. There was even a comfortable armchair and a large writing desk, so I could do some work on my computer. 3. Value for money (affordability). Paris is a very expensive city, but this gem of a hotel was surprisingly affordable (though not cheap by any means). 4. Staff. They were generally polite and pleasant. 5. Breakfast. This was a buffet-style breakfast served in pleasant surroundings. There could be more variety of food on offer, but for a 3-star hotel in Paris, this is probably as good as it gets. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and would consider staying there again on my next visit to this fabulous city.","September 9, 2017","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

309,"My sister and I spent 4 nights here in May on her first-ever time in Paris (it was my first time back in 30 years). The rate was reasonable and the amenities, especially daily breakfast, were wonderful for the price. The front desk is staffed round-the-clock and nearly all the staff spoke English well enough that we had no problems communicating. The hotel is very close to the Arc du Triomphe, which I worried would mean we were in an overly touristy area. All it turns out to mean is that the hotel is very used to international tourists and is happy to serve them. The breakfast buffet included endless amounts of cafe au lait, cheese, ham, fruit, bread and croissants. The lobby was lovely and the room (especially compared to the ""double"" we had at a budget hotel in London) was spacious enough for two of us to feel comfortable, with a full modern bath (with a tub/shower you could actually turn around in without banging a body part into a fixture!). The location was ideal to hop on the Metro to go anywhere, and just a block or so from the Champs Elysees. We felt safe and comfortable and the staff was friendly and kind. The hotel is on a street with a beer bar on one side and a full-service restaurant immediately across. We also found a small convenience store to buy fruit, snacks and drinks just a few doors down. As newbies in Paris, we didn't spend much time in the room other than sleeping, so we didn't much care that the TV was terrible.

315,"he location is FANTASTIC!! I never felt unsafe walking alone to the hotel late at night. Takes about 2 minutes to walk to the nearest metro (if you don't count the lights you have to cross). And 5 minutes walk to Champs-Élysées. The room was very clean, the Air conditioner was excellent in the hot Paris days. There were lots of different lights so you could choose how bright you wanted the room to be. My room had a bath and shower in one. Very nice. Good Closet space. As I was staying alone, I kinda expected a small bed but turned out to be a huge bed, maybe queen size I think. There were hard wood floors and I LOVED IT!! much better than the carpets in American Hotels. They change all towels every day and make sure you have extra soap by the sink. There is also soap to shower with that was very nice (I forgot mine at home)To walk to the nearest grocery store takes about 8-10 minutes, not that long.A very small problem, if you can call it that. If there is a ""do not disturb"" sign on your door, they cleaning staff still knocks on your door. I came to the hotel once at 5 am and went to bed at 6 am on Sunday morning. They knocked on the door at noon to see if they should clean. I was already up but what if I wanted to sleep longer? But as I say, very small problem but I wouldn't let this stop me at all from staying there again :) I would stay there again for sure if and when I travel again to Paris!","July 11, 2017","5    Hotel Cecilia Paris

Our room was small but very clean and fresh and to be honest we didn't come to Paris to spend any time in our room other than to sleep so it was a non issue.

This is a great home base for a visit to Paris. Not too far from the action but quiet. - We had a standard room which was pretty cozy.

342,"My husband and I visited Maison Astor Paris from 6th June for 3 nights. We were travelling for business reasons and to enjoy some time to look at a chateau. The hotel was in a really good location, one road back from the main road so it was a lovely walk to the Champs - Elysee, which meant we got to see lots and had a really good nights sleep. Really comfortable bed, nice bed linen, beautiful decor, nice fluffly towels and elegantly styled bathroom. I am quite a particular guest and found the hotel beautifully clean! We had champagne in the cute bar and ate every night (great menu - try the lamb rack) in the dining room which had a lovely glass ceiling. Breakfast was plentiful and staff were eager to assist with any request (i.e. me wanting my oranges sliced in sections etc!) Tickets were organised for the Eifel tower and we were pleased with the tour company. The conceirge and door staff were super we needed valet parking and they were super. (our French is not very good and they were most helpful). Reception staff were welcoming, efficient and speedy and the Maitre D in the restaurant was most helpful (one evening we asked for the lights to be lowered and they accommodated our request. We have stayed in numerous hotels in cities - we last stayed at the Shangri la when in Paris - but we enjoyed the Maison Astor Paris with it's boutique feel so much more.

It was a memorable experience, excellent 3-day stay and everything was beyond our expectation. The location was superb, especially for travellers who love to explore the city by foot. The room was extra comfortable, proper bed prepared for an extra person and had great ambience. The hotel design is modern and chic, and culturally-rich at the same time. The front desk staff spoke eloquent English, but the most exemplary were the breakfast lounge staff. They were very warm and welcoming, upon realising that we are devout Muslims, they advised on which food we should avoid and offered for specially-prepared omelette for us. The concierge staff helped us with the direction along the city, and booked us a nice ride to Disneyland on our departure day.

346,"This was my second stay at the Maison Astor this year, with this stay being for 5 nights, as we exhibited at the Paris International Airshow (Le Bourget). The hotel has a wonderful location within easy walking distance to the Champs-Élysées, the Louvre museum and Rue Saint-Honoré with it's amazing high end fashion stores etc. The hotel has recently been extensively refurbished and the room I stayed in (715) had a queen bed and functional, if narrow, bathroom. The room did have one major additional feature...a view of the Eiffel Tower. It wasn't the most amazing view, but it was pretty cool to start the day seeing sunlight on the Eiffel Tower and finishing it with a view of the tower illuminated at night. We didn't dine at the hotel (think about it...we're in Paris!) but we did sample the bar most evenings and the staff were very courteous and reasonably prompt with the drinks (the bar tender also serves the hotel restaurant and on some evenings it took a short while to locate him). The breakfast was well presented and tasty (including a combination of European meat and cheeses with fresh bread, in addition to cooked eggs and typical US fare) additionally the hotel kindly moved up the start of breakfast servings for us, to accommodate our early departure for the Airshow. Overall an excellent location on a quiet side street in a central Paris location, with attentive and professional staff and it's a Hilton property, so that always helps with the Hilton Honors Points accrued :)","June 24, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

350,"We chose the Maison Astor because it seemed a good points value, and that assumption proved true. This is a good, European boutique hotel in a terrific central location. If you are a Diamond, it’s a solid choice. The rooms are adequate, if unremarkable, the (included for Diamonds) breakfast is pretty good, if not amazing, and the service is excellent, if not beyond what we should expect from Hilton.I still miss the old Hilton L’Arc de Triumph, now the non-Hilton L’Hotel Du Collectonneur. The rooms there were unbelievable (for Europe), the Executive Longe was the best in the world, the service was “wow,” and Hilton Diamonds were treated like royalty. Don’t expect anything like that at the Maison Astor (not that any of us actually deserve it). No exec suite (of course, in a Curio), no real room upgrade, and no acknowledgement of your preferred status beyond water bottles. For the most part, you’ll just be another, well treated guest in whatever type of room you paid for. And that’s good enough.Overall, the Maison Astor is a good Diamond find and a great way to use points. The location is so perfect that you’ll forget what you’re not getting in the hotel. It’s an ideal combination: a quiet spot in the middle of everything. The rooms are clean and up to date, and this hotel has few flaws, certainly none fatal. You won’t be blown away, but you will be comfortable.A few suggestions for management. First, get plugs in the bathrooms. In these small rooms, there’s no place to use as an alternative, and my wife was really frustrated with hair drying and styling options as a result. Second, add instructions to the non-standard (even for Europe) thermostat, which took me longer to figure out than any I’ve encountered globally. I half wonder if many reviewers who complain about HVAC problems (no AC) just never figured out how to turn it on. I showed a neighbor in a nearby room how to get his room cool after he complained that his open window wasn’t doing the job. (For MA guests, you have to turn on the power, switch to cool mode, select your preferred temperature AND turn on the fan.) The showers could also use some improvement. The hand wands don’t go high enough and the doors are to small for North American style bathing, and since nearly all of you customers are American or British, that matters. I could offer a few more, but these are the easiest to address. Small quibbles for a good hotel.The closest Metro stop is Madeleine, and it’s about .5 miles from the hotel. Central Paris is easily walkable from the hotel, and everything else is a short Metro or Uber away. From Madeleine, it’s just a few stops to the train station (Gar), from which you can make day trips out of the city (like Versailles or Fontainebleau).The easiest and cheapest way to get to the MA from CDG is to catch the Opera Roissybus between terminals 2E and 2F. It’s .8 miles (15 minutes) walk from the hotel, costs just €12/person, and makes the trip in less than an hour, which is about as good as you can do. Once at Opera, take Rue de Mathurins, then stay straight onto Rue Roquepine, then tun left onto Rue D’Astorg. The Maison Astor will then be 1/2 block on your right. Very simple.","June 18, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

352,"My wife & I stayed here for two nights upon arriving to Paris. Full disclosure - I've been a Hilton HHonors member for almost two decades and being able to use points for this was the primary reason for choosing this hotel. Our thoughts on the property were:Location: Great - you can easily walk to the fashion district or a take a bit longer walk to many of the famous Paris landmarks. It should also be noted there is a Monoprix store nearby. If you're not familiar with them, they are a major retail chain that is the equivalent of a Target in the US. We went there the first day to stock up on water, soda and snacks which was much less expensive than getting them from the hotel.Staff: Great - Fluent in English; friendly, were very helpful in booking our transportation to the train station for our departureRoom: Good. We had an interior facing room which kept noise to a minimum. Room was nice, looked recently renovated and stylish. My two criticisms of the room were the shower and the bed. If you look at images of the bathroom, you can see that the shower is only half covered. The problem is that there is an opening in the seam that separates the glass and the wall which led to some big puddles on the floor after showering. Also, the mattress was soft. My wife likes that, but I prefer a firmer mattress, so my back was pretty sore after just two nights. Food: Very Good. Breakfast was included with our reservation. The selection was pretty typical, eggs, sausage/bacon, potatoes, fresh fruit, cereal and pastries. Everything was tasty, but nothing was amazing. We did not have any other meals here.I would stay there again using points, but I do think it would be a bit expensive if I was paying cash.","June 16, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

355,"Following check-in on May 31 and using an Amex card, I traveled to a nearby restaurant when the credit card was rejected. This was humiliating to no end. I then called Amex and inquired about the problem. It seems the hotel placed a hold for double the amount of the expected charges which placed the card over its credit limit.I went to the front desk and brought the problem to their attention. The lady there told me there was nothing they could do. The duty manager then came out and suggested there was nothing they could do as well other than process the check out early. He thought that would release the hold.The next day, I saw that nothing had changed with my account. The double hold was still there and my card remained useless. I called Amex again and they gave me a special merchant number for the hotel to call and release the hold.Back to the front desk I go and provide the number to the clerk and once again explain the problem. She dialed the number but then handed the phone to me! The Amex representative told me that there was nothing they could do without the merchant number, transaction number, etc. etc., none of which the desk clerk could provide.Not to make this a ""don't you know who I am"" moment, but I am a long time diamond member and nothing like this has ever happened.

Our room was missing a desk chair; asked front desk twice if one could be supplied, but nothing happened. The following day encountered housekeeping who managed to find a chair………..As many other reviewers who stayed over the Easter period have pointed out, it was unseasonably warm over Easter and according to management it was not easily possible to switch the main a/c settings from ‘winter’ to ‘summer’. For a major hotel chain and boutique brand this was ludicrous and the sort of thing one can encounter in a 2-3 star hotel located around the Mediterranean. Poor management was further reflected in the front desk saying there were no fans available either and to open the room windows/French doors, which fortunately we could and did, but to little avail in relieving the very warm weather conditions. We noted a number of guests went and purchased their own fans – I hope they billed Hilton.

362,"There are many nice things about this hotel (e.g. location, room decor, breakfast), and the staff was very helpful and accommodating, but there is one major issue that needs to be dealt with. The HVAC system is from the stone age (seemingly can't provide the Hotel heat and a/c at the same time). We stayed in mid May and our room felt like an oven because the Hotel was still set to heat. We tried many things but finally changed hotels to get a good night's sleep. This is just not something I expect to have to consider when staying at a Curio brand hotel.

363,"Hotel is newly renovated, rooms are on the smaller side but in line with what you usually get in paris. I liked the location a lot but the most important criteria for me is a good night sleep and here the hotel fails. Even the hotel is newly renovated they have no ventilation system, i didn't even ask for AC as the temperatures were not too high , just some fresh air. That didn't exist and the room was hot and stuffy, only solution is too sleep with open widows what almost every one is doing and therefore you hear all conversations, snoring , etc from everyone facing the courtyard. Front desk’s solution was to offer a fan. Sorry but in this hotel category , end Mai in central Europe , it is really not too much to ask to have some kind of ventilation working.","May 23, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

367,"I booked another Curio hotel and prepaid and was moved here 2 months before we arrived. You think these facts alone would make their customer service go above and beyond but alas no.Firstly this hotel was designed by someone who clearly doesn't stay in hotels.From the first impression of a busy and loud reception with several guests audibly complaining about something to staff to the gym which is not a gym and purely for decoration to the roof top terrace that we mistakenly choose.The terrace looks great but it was so cold and rainy in May that we couldn't use the terrace and the fact is it has been designed for one person not two.We had 4 cases and the wardrobe could barely fit one so we gave up and just had our suitcases opened on the floor. Nice.There is a small bathroom with 2 horrible showers which you spend all your time trying to balance the cold and hot but only one sink, why?There is a small toilet which you can barely use.There is no dining table but a bar area. They give you 2 bottles of water but no means to open them. So you have to ask room service to come and open them, just bizarre.I asked why and was told their high paying guests keep stealing the opener. I said just bring our bottles already opened and they got the hint and gave me an opener which amazingly I left for the next guests...and did not steal.On the first morning we didn't know what time we'd wake so couldn't preorder breakfast for the room as it required a time. So I optimistically rang room service through reception and was told that unless I had filled in the preorder and put it on the door handle outside the night before I couldn't have any...yeah that's right...no room service in a Hilton owned hotel.There was no room service menu in the room. Guess that's why Deliveroo appeared popular.There are many great places nearby to have a cheaper cooked breakfast so we went their instead.So 2nd morning I preordered as I thought it would be nice to actually to have a meal in our room. It was fine if limited. We went out came back at 4pm and the trays and breakfast were still there...I rang to complain and was greeted with a ""so? what would you like me to do"". I said sarcastically how about cleaning the room?it summed up their reception customer service. we were clearly an inconvenience and they would prefer no guests who demanded a clean room...i also had to chase up replacements of water, coffee and tea...yeah in a 4 star hotel.when I checked in I had confirmed to them that I had prepaid. so on checkout I expected a smooth check out. nope. they had no record of my prepayment and even the fact that they had moved me from one of their hotels to another. disappointing to say the least. so basically they tried to steal a second lot of room money from me. outraged I said I had confirmation emails of all this but that I should not have to get my lap top out and find them as this was their job to make my life easier not harder and leave a good impression not bad ..they failed.so they now have to check their records and refund my blocked out money but they couldn't do it then as the manager was not free...or I'll be reporting them for stealing a customers money and tarnishing the Hilton brand yet further.Given their attitude to customer service while I was there this ending didn't surprise me. Disappointing all the same.Don't stay here.","May 19, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

They are professional, knowledgeable and cordial and always made us feel welcomed. The restaurant staff, helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good, dinner was great.My wife and I were there celebrating our 30th anniversary. The hotel manager had a bottle of champagne and some delicious cookies in our room upon check in and that was a very nice surprise.We are Hilton Diamond members. We made our reservations in November 2018 for our May 2019 stay. I had requested a room with a balcony on our reservation. I was really disappointed that we did not get that room. As a matter of fact, I don't think we got any type of room upgrade. Our room was tiny and the French doors opened to an interior courtyard. When we checked in, the front desk agent told us that there was nothing else available. It made me really question the value of focusing my business on Hilton, given that Diamond status and 7 months advanced notice did not warrant a room upgrade.","May 17, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

The rooms were clean and in great shape. The food was delicious (I ordered room service a few times.) I felt like they went out of their way to ""surprise and delight"" guests. The location is great--while the actual street is quiet, it's a very central location in an upscale neighborhood. Some of my favorite times were just were just walking in the area. The rooms are small, but 1. it's Paris, so that's unreasonable to expect anything else, and 2. you should be outside all day, so it won't even matter.","May 15, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

He provided excellent dining suggestions off the beaten path, along with many other helpful ideas throughout our stay. The rest of the hotel staff were also quite helpful and charming. The rooms were spotless and comfortable, and looked out on an inner courtyard that highlighted the subtle architectural features of the building.

377,"I’ve stayed in several hotels around the world - from Brazil, Peru, Cape Town, Iceland, Austria, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, Macchu Pichu, California, Malaysia, Singapore, HK, Boston, NYC, Tokyo - and this was the first time in Europe that I stayed in a hotel that had NO AC (airconditioning). What’s worse is that I was not informed by the front desk upon check-in. This was not also on the website. When I went to my room, it was hot. I thought the AC was busted. When I called the front desk, that’s when they told me about the AC issue. Couldn’t believe it. Because of that issue, I had to leave the window open to let the breeze in. Unfortunately, by having it open, the street noise also could be heard - even the banging of the trash compactor every few hours (I was even wearing earplugs). I had lousy sleep throughout my stay, which I sorely needed since I was tired from my Iceland trip. Sigh. When we came back at night one time, an envelope was on the desk for a Mr. Romero - who was not me. And because someone from the hotel staff entered the room to deliver that envelope, the “Make Up Room” signage fell and our room was not cleaned. Good job hotel staff (sarcastic). I normally don’t complain about things like the above but I couldn’t help myself. I finally talked to the quality manager who thankfully was accommodating and apologetic. She was able to appease us so thanks to the manager. She was the lone bright spot in this hotel. One other issue was with my request for 2 laundry bags. I called at 11 PM to request for them, and one hour later, still no bags. So I went down to the front desk only to be told that they had run out of bags and that I should call at 7 AM the next day (when someone from Housekeeping is available). Firstly, I have never encountered a hotel running out of laundry bags and secondly, I wish they had the courtesy to return my call to inform me that they had run out. Eventually, the next day, I called housekeeping at 8:30 AM and asked for TWO (2) laundry bags. I only got ONE (1). Face palm moment there. The icing on the cake? When we booked our taxi the night before checking out, we explicitly said that we were heading to Gare du Nord (train station North). The next day, the luggages were loaded in the taxi, and then the concierge asks me what terminal. I reply, “No, we are going to Gare du Nord.” So the driver then unloads our luggages since he was expecting that our destination was the airport. And the concierge calls for a new taxi. Good thing I had ample time prior to the departure of my train. Another face palm moment there. There are lapses in this hotel. Maybe they should retrain their staff? In fact, during check-in, the front desk staff didn’t guide us throughout the hotel. She did not show us where the restaurant was (or the breakfast times) or even just explain where the fitness center was (isn’t that protocal?). I’ve stayed at the Marriott on Hausmann and at the Hilton Opera, and also in one hotel at the Montmartre area. I WILL NEVER stay here again. VERY DISAPPOINTED. A shame though because the location of the hotel is good. Near to the shopping of Rue Saint-Honore, and maybe 20 mins walking to the Louvre on one side, and then 30 mins walk to Eiffel. 10 mins to Champs Elysees. On a side note, the concierge staff was accommodating.","April 25, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

380,"Single night stay in this Hilton branded boutique hotel. It is nice, it is extremely comfortable, it is in a lovely part of town and it is trying to be a bit of a boutique - like an old French Salon, especially the dining room. Does it pull that off - no, not especially well, the mono chrome wall paper with slightly kitchy images are too much and certainly are over bearing in my mind. The actual room layouts are difficult at best, the entrance and the dining room are both round, so it is very difficult to lay out square furniture in a way that doesnt feel like you are constantly having to weave through furniture. The bar is small - and kind of awkward. But dont let any of that spacial stuff take away from the food or the quality of the food, as ever in France the simplicity and elegance of the food is a class apart, genuinely so - the simple house pinot noir is a lovely drinkable wine, the bread at breakfast is nutty and chewy, the jams are sweet and sharp, everything about French food is the antithesis of America and you should put up with minor inconveniences to experience it.The rooms are clean and honestly fairly unspectactular - comfortable without being over the top. Chambres as the French would say - they feel like that.The location of this hotel is also lovely on a quite Parisian back street where you can whistle and smoke a Gallois on your way back from the cafe, in one of the most beautiful and romantic cities in the world.","April 23, 2019","6    Maison Astor Paris, Curio Collection by Hilton

Three other points: 1) The hotel is obviously new and the decor is ""fin de siecle"" but the interior designer, in my opinion, didn't quite get it right and the overall effect is a little ""tart's boudoir""; 2) my room at least faced into a small inner courtyard and due to the proximity of other rooms, by the end of my stay, it was starting to feel rather like being an executive jail unfortunately; 3) one of the main reason I stayed at this hotel was because of the fitness facilities that I saw on the hotel's web-site; on asking about these, I was directed to the ""fitness lounge"" in which I found a running machine and a bench only.

399,"We chose to stay here because of the hotel's proximity to the Louvre. In that respect, the hotel does not disappoint. An easy five minute walk is all it takes to get there. It's also a convenient bus ride (# 48) from Gare du Nord to it. The staff was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, the ground-floor room (# 100) we received smelled heavily of mildew. There was little natural light and the colors of the walls added to the rooms gloominess. There was a drain pipe near the door that treated us to a near constant sound of draining water through the night. If I were a younger man, I don't think these things would have been a problem. However, as I am an older man (mid-60's), these deficiencies made the night's stay uncomfortable.","September 14, 2018","7    Hotel Louvre Bons Enfants

Wife and I’s allergies would worsen only when in the room, and even upon return to the US have a lingering cough and congestion were trying to shake. At 6’0” I was too tall for shower (head hitting ceiling, had to bend every time). Breakfast offered was just alrite. Overall: Good location, bad everything else.

Everything besides the room sizes is brilliant and an amazing value. Tucked away on a side street, this 33 room boutique hotel is nearly perfect. The rooms at 10m (32 sq.ft) and 12m (39 sq ft) are very small, but efficient. nice-sized bathrooms and most 4 star services, this hotel is perfect for a short stay in the City of Light.

407,"The location could almost not have been better. Right next to the Louvre.Many great restaurants and sights nearby in walking distance.The room is sort of what you expect in Paris, much smaller and much more expensive than basically everywhere else. Fair enough. But my god the cleanliness. The bathroom was moldy and dirty, with hair and skin residue in the shower and the amount of dust under the desk was incredible. It was impossible to shower or have a bath without at least in part flooding the bathroom. The room was at the end of a very narrow hallway, which was at least in part blocked every day with different types of cleaning equipment. Fortunately the room was right next to the emergency escape, for the idea to pass all of this in case of an emergency would have been terrifying. Cleaning staff did not come every day. It would have been nice to have a clean set of sheets after two days of 25+ degrees, but well. We got an apology and some towels and toilet paper from the receptionist when we asked about the cleaning around 17:00 in the evening but it seemed like this was basically business as usual.The receptionists were helpful and friendly, however the level of cleanliness really was a dealbreaker for me. We did not have the breakfast.I do not understand the rating, either on hotels or booking.com, but I suppose putting out a free of charge half bottle of wine makes everything better.","May 28, 2018","7    Hotel Louvre Bons Enfants

The front desk and cleaning staff are super friendly and the proximity to Le Louvre and Les Tuileries is so convenient. The room is quite tight especially if you want to work at the desk. Breakfast is included as is free wifi (a little dicey at times) and TV. There is a small refrigerator and a handful of mini bar items but there was no price list for these in my room. There is also supposed to be a gym but I did not have time to locate it (which should not be difficult given the size of the place).

417,"In general a comfortable hotel, but with one minor complaint and one major complaint. First, the larger complaint, and a note of caution: the “shuttle service offered” in the hotel description is not free. While this may be expected what with the distance of the hotel to the airport, there was a frustrating lack of communication about the exact terms of this fee. When we scheduled a shuttle service, we were told to leave a “Deposit” of 16 euros. When we asked the front desk about whether we would be getting the deposit back when we showed up to the shuttle, it was suggested that this was the case. It was not, and we were only told this when the shuttle was ready to leave. This was 16 euros we were not expecting to spend, and if we knew this in advance, we would have taken public transit instead. The minor complaint, which regards the bathroom in our room: the sink in the bathroom was very slow to drain, and after simply washing one’s hands, a sizeable puddle would form. The shower glass was also organized so that your bathroom floor would be completely soaked after a shower—we had to seal off a portion of the shower with a towel to prevent a soaked floor. Beyond these things, a nice hotel in the heart of the city, but these experiences certainly soured the impression of the hotel. ","December 26, 2017","7    Hotel Louvre Bons Enfants

440,"Third time I have stayed at this hotel and I cannot find anything negative to say about it. Located close to the Palais Royal, Lourvre and less than 200 metres from the Metro it is pretty much in the perfect location. Friendly staff, good sized rooms which are equipped with everything you should need. Choices for breakfast are good and there are a lot of places close by to eat, either at lunchtime or in the evening.The hotel is also less than 100 metres from Rue Saint-Honore which is a great street to spend a morning walking the length of from Les Halles all the way to Rue La Boetie, taking in all the designer labels you want plus the E'lysee Palace and some great watering holes to stop off and people watch in.","September 3, 2016","7    Hotel Louvre Bons Enfants

441,"My husband and I booked a trip to Paris last minute and picked Hotel Bon Enfants as our base.It is located on a side street within two minutes walk of the Louvre and a metro stop just around the corner. The location is fantastic with plenty of cafes nearby and a supermarket a street away.Staff are friendly and helpful. Yes the lift is small and the corridors are tiny. Thankfully we were in room 207 which is located of a stairwell and doesn't feel so claustrophobic. The room is small but has a double bed, desk, wardrobe, mini bar and TV. The bathroom is a good size. Let's face it, you're in Paris. You're using the hotel as a base and Hotel Bon Enfants is more than adequate.Room quaint and clean and serviced every day. We would definitely stay again!","August 27, 2016","7    Hotel Louvre Bons Enfants

444,"Superb location a stones throw from the Louvre; bedroom was clean, colourful and comfortable; staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely book again- given that many inferior hotels are priced similarly for a much less central location you couldn't really ask for more.The rooms are all on first floor and higher (pretty typical for central Paris) but there is a small lift for access. Really helpful that we were able to book a triple room at only a small extra price as my sister was able to join us for a night. The triple room had very comfortable beds, and a separate toilet and bathroom which was helpful.","August 13, 2016","7    Hotel Louvre Bons Enfants

445,"I needed a room for one nite and wanted to use Marriott points. I was a bit skeptical given some of the negative reviews but my options were limited so I took a chance. The check-in staff were very polite and spoke good English. The check-in area is small so it can get crowded very quickly if there are a lot of guests arriving/departing. I got room 1925, a large king room and hoped for the best. Getting off the elevator was not encouraging. The door frames looked those of a hotel that had been used hard. However the room itself was very nice, enormous compared to many French hotel rooms. It was well appointed, the bathroom was spotless and very nicely done. No bidet so keep that in mind if that is a requirement for you. A beautiful view of eastern Paris out the window. The bed slept well and there were no surprises through the stay. Didn't eat in the restaurant but the staff did get me a coffee when the machine in the lounge area was offline for cleaning. The hotel is a five minute walk from Gare de Lyon so it is so easy to get to and use it as a home base to explore the whole of Paris. This hotel isn't in the tourist area of Paris, good or bad depending on what you want. I actually prefer eating in restaurants filled with locals rather than tourists so if that's your thing as well, then you have plenty of options within a 5-20 min walk. You can cross over the bridge to the RER and you are two stops from Muse D'Orsay and other attractions. Bottomline, I'd stay again if the need arises.","July 11, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

446,"Just arrived at the hotel after taking the train from Cannes! Check in was flawless and the staff could not have been nicer or more professional!I love our room with great views of the Basilica of Sacre Coeur! Easy walk from the Gare de Lyon. Out the main door and to the left. You can’t miss the hotel! The elevators are a bit high tech for me, but I do feel they were designed for convenience and security. One recommendation that I always tell my friends, if you are arriving early from an international flight, we always splurge and reserve the night prior to our arrival, the additional cost is well worth having your room ready, rather than hoping that you’re room will be available prior to the normal check in time!Enjoy your stay!","July 6, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

447,"We stayed at this hotel from June 13 to 16, 2019. I was assured by Andra ( who also happens to be the customer relations manager) at the time of my check in, that the room I was getting was the best one available that could be provided to a Titanium Elite Member and a Lifetime Gold Member with Marriott for the last 12 years. What we got was a room with the following:1- A broken toilet seat which was eventually repaired on our request.2-A clogged sink that took forever to drain.3-An inadequate cooling system. We repeatedly tried to set the temperature but it just wouldn’t cool down the room.4-A pungy and nauseating smell on the 15th floor that we had to deal with every time we had to exit the room or the 15th floor elevator5- A non functional garbage binI am utterly disappointed with the experience at this property and the little regard and effort taken by the staff to ensure our experience at this property was a pleasant and memorable one. What irked me the most is that despite this terrible experience I shared by feedback via email to Andra (Customer Relations Manager) and Pierre-Yves (Hotel Manager) but I never got a response from them. Terrible experience and not what you would expect from Marriott. I will not recommend this hotel to friends or family let alone give it a second chance!","July 3, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

Which made getting to and from various tourist attractions incredibly easy. The staff at the hotel was also very helpful in getting us reservations when we need help as our French was just not cutting it. Our room was nice and large with an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Coure. The hotel is walking distance to the Bastile area, which meant we had great choices for dinner. There is also an amazing bakery across the street from this hotel.

449,"I checked in at the CY Paris Gare de Lyon this Saturday morning. While the young lady very nice was, she was brand new to the job and had almost no clue on what she was doing. It took a solid 20 minutes to be checked in, despite mobile check in.Being a Titanium member I had to tell her what the benefits were, remind her it was a prepaid stay plus lots of other information. She then handed over the room cards to me and wished me a nice stay.Great but what's my room number? She apologized and said room 1712 on the first floor. I answered that I was thinking it should be the 17th floor, whereas she answered no no, first floor (in France, 1st floor is 2nd floor for the US).OK, first floor I go, which was ... the fitness center. No a big deal, I gave the 17th floor a try which was correct.I then had a nap and was suddenly waken up by the opening of the entrance door. I thought to myself that the staff should have at least knocked before entering but to my surprise it wasn't staff at all. Two people were inside my room to claim that room that has been assigned to them at check in.They were almost as chocked as me. This is just unbelievable. I immediately called the reception that put me hold, then apologized and said they will deliver some catering to my room for the inconvenience. I declined as this is not an inconvenience but an issue and sending some food and drinks were useless for me, I had dinner plans and was supposed to leave early in the morning.I dressed up and went to the reception to have an explanation. I spoke with Katia the duty manager who apologized a lot but couldn't really explain what had happened.She offered 5'000 points, free breakfast and what mattered the most to me, a call back first thing Monday morning from the reception manager to clarify what has happened.I don't like to make a big deal of problems, but here there are a lot of questions raised: how come a room can be assigned twice, what about my credit card and all private information that the hotel requests, where are they? If I wouldn't have been in the room, what would have happened? People having my room key could just take whatever they want and leave.I made the point to Katia that I want to address this issues to the upper management and again she promised the call back first thing Monday morning.I also mentioned that if I wouldn't have plans and short on time, I would have checked-out immediately as this isn't acceptable in any way.When I checked out on Sunday morning, the lady at the reception said ""let me summarize your charges: you have a breakfast and some snacks from the market"". I answered no, I don't have breakfast as Katia said it will be free of charge.Then she answered that I should have let her finished her sentence, she was about to say, the breakfast was complementary.I am sorry, this is not the way you have to say it. The right sentence would have been: "" Let me summarize your extras: you have something from the minimarket and your breakfast is complementary""Before leaving the hotel I again said I was expecting the manager to call me back Monday Morning, I was again reassured it will be done first thing.We are Tuesday, no call. I checked my Marriott account, the overnight points are here, but no sign of the 5'000 points that were promised.Beside the safety and security issue of booking and giving access to the same room to different customer, the lack of follow up and mistake ownership is dramatic. I will also follow up with Marriott directly as this is just unacceptable.Needless to say that I will not give this hotel a second try.","June 24, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

450,"I have been traveling to Paris on an almost annual basis for over a dozen years now. This was my first foray into a big chain hotel. What appealed to me at the time of booking was that it was brand spanking new and had an appealing aesthetic. While slightly outside of the center, it is conveniently located minutes away from Gare de Lyon, where you can hop on line 1 and 14 quite easily. There's a Starbucks next door if that's your thing (I personally avoid Starbucks whilst in Paris), as well as a Paul and Eric Kayser nearby if you're not wanting to spring for the 19 euro breakfast. There's also a Monop (smaller version of Monoprix) about five minutes away on foot if you're needing to stock up on water and snacks. As for the hotel itself, the way the rooms are laid out, each room has a view of the city, but the premium views are that of the Eiffel and the Sacre Couer. Having never stayed in a room with a view of the Eiffel, we were excited at the prospect of being able to see it outside our window but when we stepped into our room (1903), we realized tht we had to lean over to be able to see it in the distance. We did feel that the room was very spacious and it was probably the largest room we've had in Paris. The bathroom was fairly large for Paris standards as well. Now for the cons. The smell. Room 1903 had an odd stench masked by a fragrance that was a combination of lemon and musk, like a really bad men's drugstore cologne. I am assuming the scent was used to hide the smell emanating from the bathroom. Others have commented on the disaster of the design that is their bathtub. I can imagine pregnant women and elderly individuals having great difficulty getting in an out of the tub. Also, since the door to the bathroom is basically a glass enclosure, you will be awakened at night if a fellow room occupant goes to the loo and you are sensitive to light. Forget about privacy if you have to relieve yourself. Be aware that the light from your open window can be reflected onto the adjacent business building, which means that your fellow guests may be able to see you at night. Keep your curtains closed!Housekeeping was subpar. We stayed in two rooms over the course of our 5-night stay and both rooms were not vacuumed well, if at all. We accidentally broke one of the glasses in the bathroom and housekeeping failed to remove and replace for two days. When we checked into our second room after a long day of sightseeing, our sofa bed was not made up and we had to wait for someone to come and put sheets on. When someone finally arrived, all he did was lay the flat sheet on top of the mattress. Breakfast was fine but definitely not worth the 19 euros. However, since children are free, it balances it out. Front desk staff were all very polite and attempted to be as helpful as possible.","June 18, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

The closet is tiny as well and barely fit my clothes, not sure how they expect it to fit stuff for 2 people. The entire room has 1 drawer and a shelf, not enough storage space.

The buffet was plentiful and very good and both the Night Manager and the morning Manager were very helpful and great! On arriving to our room we did notice an odor in the room and bathroom that came and went , but was definently noticeable. As we had been told at check-in that the facility was at full capacity, I did not request a room change until the morning of our 3rd day there. Katia , at the front desk, immediately responded by offering us a high floor room which we readily accepted . The view was amazing! This mystery odor has been mentioned here before and they need to resolve that. We very much enjoyed our stay there, however, would be hesitant to stay again unless it is cleared up. The staff was very efficient and friendly and everything else was very much in line to receive a 5 star review.","April 12, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

The people from the Hotel with who I had the pleasure to collaborate were taking care about all the details of our event, before and during the course of it. My person of contact from the Hotel was Marie Barbou and she coordinated everything very well, attending all our requests during the event. Besides the great organitsation and disposition of the events coordination team, the facilities of business area are very well equiped as they offer a variety of amenities to make you event even more special and a full success (sound system integrated in the meeting room, permanent coffee breaks, free break out rooms, candy bar, intelligent white boards, possibility to have breakfast in the business meeting rooms area...).

The bed was super comfortable. Nice clean well appointed furnishings. The bathroom was very large and super clean with a nice size bathtub not sure if all rooms have tubs but ours e was a small empty refrigerator in our room which was wonderful for being able to chill a nice bottle of wine or keep water cold. Great AC. The front desk staff were very helpful, friendly. Easy check in and check out. there is a small little market you can get snacks, bottles of water, sodas and even wine. the hotel restaurant has one of the best burgers I have ever had.

Check in and check out was a breeze. Staff as nice too. Get a room on the higher floors if you don't want any noise. We stayed on the second floor but we were still able to sleep soundly at night despite the noise from cars outside. Only downside was that they don't have bell boys to help with your luggage and we traveled with 4 huge luggage. I asked the reception guy to help with our luggage and he gladly obliged. I would recommend this hotel. Value for money.","April 2, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

Requests from the room takes quite a bit of time to be fulfilled. I wait sometimes for half an hour before receiving the items I requested. 2. The front desk staff may be friendly and helpful. But they are busy most of the time. You would need to queue for some time to ask for simple directions. The staff at the main door couldn't speak in English. I think the hotel might be understaffed.

473,"Stayed for a week in March on a sightseeing trip to Paris. The location is great - just outside the crush of the crowded tourist areas. The train/Metro station, that can take you anywhere in the city, is right at the hotel's front door. We easily navigated the train from CDG Airport to Gare de Lyon station, and used the Metro to get around thereafter. The front desk and restaurant staff were very helpful, and while they endured our attempts at speaking French, were all quite fluent in English. The hotel itself is a brand new building, and extremely modern in style for a Courtyard by Marriott brand property. The room was quite small, and the WC was particularly unusual. It was also a very tiny space, separated from the rest of the room by frosted glass walls and a glass door with a wide gap that didn't afford the bathroom user any privacy at all. A case of style over function, for sure, but absolutely not ideal when sharing the room with another person. Overall, a very good choice when visiting Paris.","March 24, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

Service from the front desk was excellent and the hotel was spotless. I communicated with the front desk prior to my arrival with a couple special requests and they followed through flawlessly. They also spoke excellent English. The location CANNOT be beat- it's next to the Gare de Lyon train station and subway stops. The rooms are modern and comfortable, too. Pricing for breakfast is a bit steep- 19 Euros, but everything looked very good (and there is a Starbucks right next door if you want to grab something small and go).

478,"Location is great, near the metro station as well as the train station. I was greeted with a warm welcome and a nice staff. Check in/out was a breeze. The queen room was a nice size, it was clean, and the advance room rate was a steal! The bathroom is separated by a tempered glass wall, so if the light is turned on in the middle of the night, it’ll wake you up. The water pressure in the shower is good and the water is hot no matter what time of day or night you use it. There’s no microwave in the room, but there’s a fridge and free tea. There was just one minor problem…there was a sewer smell in my room, but it was too late in the night for me to change. The front desk was fast to respond and send a maintenance guy to check it out. He came and sprayed. The next morning I smelled that same smell in the hallway, so I just figured that smell is just gonna be there.

482,"I am only 3 days into an 8-day stay, and I am not happy for the following reasons:(1) At around 6pm this evening, I had just showered in my room after a workout and was completely naked. A housekeeper then entered my room completely unannounced and WITHOUT KNOCKING, and I am pretty sure she saw me naked before I could yell at her to get out. This is completely unacceptable and a massive invasion of privacy. She then ran into the housekeeping closet on my floor to hide and would not come back out even to apologize. That is not how you recover from problems in a hotel.(2) On Monday and Tuesday, renovation work and very loud drilling was occurring on what seemed like the room right above mine (I am on floor 2). It starts first thing in the day and lasts for the majority of the day, which has affected my sleep and my ability to work peacefully in my room. It would've been nice to be warned about this loud drilling and hammering during my 8-day stay.I gave my stay 2 stars instead of 1 was because of a waitress in the restaurant who provided impeccable service, and the rooms themselves are immaculate.","January 22, 2019","8    Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon

488,"Spent 9 nights here on the 17th floor facing the city with an expansive view of everything from the Eiffel tower to Mountmartre. Hotel has only been open for about 2 months. A few small kinks to be worked out. These were- the elevators have a good security system to prevent unauthorized access to the floors. Using your room key you key in the floor you want. The system doesn't always work selecting the right floor, so make sure that the correct floor is shown before getting on the elevator. Elevator timing is a little fast on entering, so watch the closing doors. The lobby area is small, but on multiple occasions there was a smell of methane sewer gas wafting in the area. Not real strong, but off putting. Outside there is still construction going on and there is a set of steps to the left of the front entrance that are not marked. As we left on our last day a guest had not seen the steps and fell down. These steps need to be marked or removed. They appear to be left over from whatever was there before the hotel was built. The breakfast was plentiful and offered a choice of both hot or cold selections. The wait staff in the restaurant was very helpful. Ate a couple time other than breakfast. menu is limited but adequate and food is good. Location is excellent if you are traveling to southern France [ Gare de Lyon] of just across the river the Gare de Austerlitz. Also you can catch the Metro and RER lines in either station. There are multiple restaurants in the area, some pretty good. The room we had was a nice size, the housekeeping was excellent and our room was always clean when we returned from a day on the town. The front desk staff was very helpful with information on how to get to various locations such as Versailles and outlying area. Lots of business travelers coming and going but also some tourists. Language is not a problem as the front desk and restaurant staff speak multiple languages.

And most of the higher rooms have really good views. Security seems good too! There are just a few minor design defects. Most significant, is the shower head which is cheap and awkward, and the tub that is hard to enter/exit safely. Worst of all is the glass door between the bedroom and bathroom that floods the room with light. Try sleeping through that if your roommate visits the loo in the middle of the night!The rooms are really tidy, with safe, fridge, a nice table for working or eating, and a hot water kettle for instant coffee and tea.

They said they would get a room ready as soon as possible and would call us. We were in our room by 11:15am. It is a brand new hotel and the rooms were very nice. A large King bed and Flat screen TV.

499,"My wife and I stayed at the beginning of July for four nights. Upon check in we were told of an unexpected sailing so we had to schedule our trip around that. We requested a table reservation for the dinner that was to be served during the sailing and was told that a table could be arranged but they wouldn't be able to feed us because they were fully booked, and they were going to prepare meals for the other guests but not for us. We rushed our day to make the sailing on time which included a meal at a nearby restaurant because we were expecting to not be offered dinner with the other guests only to discover during the sailing that we could've eaten a nice dinner while sailing like everyone else. After getting into the room we did a quick inspection and found copious amounts of mould in the shower. The room smelled mouldy and the front desk clerk was very unhelpful and even went as far as to ignore us mid conversation to pick up the phone and talk to her friends for the next five minutes. The next day we set off for our adventures around Paris and returned in the late evening to find our hotel room door left wide open to any stranger passing by. Not sure why but they also removed the garbage can from our room and some of the complimentary toiletries. We had the shower drain back up on us while showering and went to report it to the front desk, they didn't care or know what to do about it. All in all a very unprofessional environment for a hotel or any sort of accommodation in the hospitality industry. Book elsewhere folks. Not cheap. Mouldy.

501,"My entire day was ruined yesterday. I checked in and paid on arrival as your receptionist asked me to. I wish I had not. I booked this stay as I saw on your website that there is a cruise and dinner. I asked the receptionist when shown our room what time dinner was and she informed me there was no dinner and no cruise. I said I wanted to cancel my stay as the only reason I booked was for the romantic cruise, dinner and sleep on the Seine. My special day with my wife has been ruined. It is completely my fault As I did not see cruises were only week-ends but your staff handled it terribly and just dismissed any mention of my refund of €245 for a bed, toilet and shower. No Meal, no bar, no cruise. I was forced to leave and find other accommodation at a cost of €177. (why would I stay on an empty boat on the dock)So my experience of Le VIP Paris is a loss of €422 and no special night for my wife that I had planned. Terrible attitude by the manager. Completely let down by your company.You only get one star as I have to click to submit. It should be NO STARS.","August 22, 2018","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

502,"Booking:My girlfriend offered me a dinner and night on the VIP Paris yacht. We were supposed to have dinner in the end of July but my girlfriend got really sick and we had to postpone it. That meant we had to pay a fee of 100 euros!! We took the next available date which was in October. When we arrived at the reception on the boat, we also had to leave a 100 euro deposit for the room. And the breakfast costs 17 euros per person!! The guy at the reception was kind enough to offer us the breakfast because of the 100 euros extra fee we already had to pay.Location: The boat is located near Gare de Lyon but I wouldn't say it was easy to find. We spent at least half an hour looking for the boat and don't expect them to answer your calls if don't find the boat. Dinner: The dinner was really great! I definitely enjoyed the food and the singer during the dinner cruise. The view from our table was great and I truly had a wonderful evening with my girlfriend. The only negative point of the dinner was the price. Expect to pay at least 17 euros for a glass of Champagne and not under 20 euros for a half bottle of red wine. Night: The night on the boat was terrible. The boat was staying next to a nightclub-boat. I didn't get much sleep because of the music and the pounding basses. Breakfast: Because of the price (17 euros/person) I was expecting a truly amazing breakfast. I was really disappointed. You get some coffee and pain au chocolat but don't expect much more! I also noted the complete lack of personnel during the breakfast.I will recommend the VIP Paris but only the dinner. It was really memorable and really enjoyed view of Paris by night accompanied by the great performance from the singer.","October 26, 2017","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

504,"I have gone to quite a few weddings, both American and French, but this one was LEGENDARY. I got married on this boat and I must say that this venue is as good as it gets if you want to be sure to have an amazing event. I will be looking to come back for some anniversary celebrations!! :D So many of our guests described the evening as either the best wedding they can remember or one of their top life events period. The owner never ceased to bend over backwards to accommodate our needs and requests and to make little tweaks that we had not even thought of that made everything come off perfectly. No stress, no mistakes, no failures, no missed opportunities. I recommend this venue from the bottom of my heart and assure you that you are in good hands while on board. We reserved about one year in advance and given we had more than 120 people, the package that the owner proposed to us included just about everything we could want. For the per-person price that he quoted us - the package included the reservation of the entire boat from 4pm Saturday to 1pm Sunday, and this includes all 23 cabins which roomed about 48 guests for the event. The guests were required to pay for the rooms in addition to the wedding package but for an extremely reasonable price given the boat's location in the middle of Paris. Our suite was included free of charge and it had its own private deck behind the boat. First of all, the owner is the major asset of this boat. He has an amazing ability to remain calm and positive in all situations and he is very kind in general. Furthermore, he has done this kind of event so frequently that he is able to predict problems and resolve them before they even arise. Basically, the boat's crew managed things so well that we had very little to take care of regarding the preparation of the venue (except delivering the decorations the day before and organizing the photographer, our own cake, and some other little details). The boat even proposes a photographer option if you want them to manage that as well!Our price included an introductory hour of champagne, a delicious 28 piece cocktail-style dinner served to the guests by a wonderful waitstaff, very nice quality red and white wine served with dinner, a dessert (wedding cake), and a great DJ. Plus the boat owner managed the entire event and everything went forward like clockwork. Also, the boat has an arch already in place that can be decorated and used for the wedding ceremony backdrop. Given we had our own cake, the owner agreed to give us coffee, juice, and pastries for brunch instead!!Second, the experience of floating (fairly quickly) down the Seine, surrounded by friends and family while watching the beautiful sights of Paris fly by and dancing to your favorite songs is something magical that everyone who lives in (or even visits) Paris should experience at least once in a lifetime. Actually, this should just be something everyone does as regularly as possible :) The ceremony took place with the boat parked perfectly with the Eiffel Tower in the background. Also, as you go down the Seine, you have to duck your head or sit down for some bridges because the party takes place in the open air on the upper deck and you can reach out and touch the underside of several ancient bridges. The experience is breathtaking!Finally, there is a large dining room where the part can continue after the cruise without bothering the neighbors (too much) at the dock. The dining room opens up onto a lower exterior deck so people can still easily get fresh air. Also, there is a system to project photos and slideshows. The DJ was very talented but at the same time, completely willing to listen to our requests and ideas. In the end the music was a mix between our playlists and his own song ideas and we had a hard time keeping people from dancing non-stop until 5am!! He also took care of the microphones and PA system for the ceremony for a small supplementary fee (totally worth it). At the end, people could stay very late because they were sleeping on board. Such a strong point.","September 28, 2015","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

Breakfast was a little expensive...but if you have a healthy appetite in the morning it's very reasonable. The wine prices are'nt cheap. 30 quid a bottle. However, I can not rave enough about the whole experience. The staff are so helpful. English is spoken very well. The cruise was amazing. The rooms are great.

507,Myself and my fiancé have just returned from a trip to Paris where we stayed on the Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel. We had a lovely stay on the boat and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of the riverboat cruise. The bedrooms where small however where very clean and had a lovely large comfy bed. The bathroom was also small but clean and had nice complimentary toiletries. Perfect for a one night stay. The starter was not to our taste however we enjoyed the rest of the meal very much. We found that the price of drinks was very expensive. All in all we very much enjoyed our stay.,"April 2, 2015","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

508,"I dont even know where to start with this hotel... you are supposed to book a luxury-romantic night and it turns out to be nothing like that. DONT GO... here is our experience:- Room: super small, you almost cant open the wardrobe because there is no space. The walls-furniture-wood were very old. The room has this light option with different colors and rhythms that reminded us of a cheap motel. Bathroom was super small and old.- Upgrade to superior room: is the biggest joke. You pay 51€ to enjoy a ""view"" to the river... the boat is located outside the city so all you see is a green -modern- ugly building. The windows are so small that you cannot see anything (in case there was anything to see...) and on top of everything they have a second boat with a restaurant right next to the main boat, so the first thing you see is the deck of this boat.- Dinner: drinks are not included (and are very expensive), quality is bad, quantity is poor. It is true the cruise was nice, but you do this in any other boat from 15 € per person and not 250 €. I had the feeling it was pure scamming what they were doing. We couldn't enjoy the dinner because we couldn't stop thinking of the money we were paying for that!! it is unacceptable!! and everything looks tacky with the lights and the layout...they try to make it look luxurious but not even the waitress come anywhere near to fancy.- ""Extras"": 30€ for a bouquet of flowers, which turned out to be 5 roses. 26 € for parking per night (when there is zero control and pretty much not a car was there). 40€ for a love pack (which includes some massage oil and another couple of worthless things.- Personal: they couldn't speak English, they were not unfriendly but they were also not friendly and the service was for a 3 stars hotel.We booked it in Groupon and was half price (around 260 €) but I wouldn't have paid more than 50€ for sleeping there. I could only imagine people that paid around 500€.Don't ever go there, there are thousands of more romantic and luxury plans to do in Paris. And when I read the nice reviews about this hotel I can only imagine that we were in different hotels becuase I really cant understand it.","February 6, 2015","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

509,"The concept is very nice with a diner-cruise on the Seine, seeing all important sites under a very priviledged angle. The set-up is quite exclusive (max 70p. on the boat) and the staff is extremely friendly. Unfortunately, the food is, though quite good, nothing like a 4-5 stars cuisine but the drinks are priced as if it was: 8 € for a coke !!! Your bill can go sky high if you pick all the numerous options presented (flowers, breakfast, premium cabin, etc). Cabins are very ok with nice bathrooms and good beds. So all in all, stick to the basic set-up (may be a superior cabin with river view is the exception) and enjoy a lovely moment in Paris.","July 21, 2014","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

This 'hotel', as it turned out, duly set sail at 8pm and joined the yachts plying the Seine and offering dinner with views of Paris thrown in. It was a bit odd at first finding myself a single on something of a Love Boat - my fellow diners were all couples totally wrapped up in each other. Still, the hostesses paid me ample attention, and music and good food and Paris was more than enough for yours truly.

511,"I hate to leave a negative review, but I have been meaning to leave feedback for a while on a dinner cruise my boyfriend and I took in January. I had been really looking forward to celebrating our anniversary with a romantic dinner cruise, however after having difficulty finding the yacht initially, we were boarded on to a tiny, very unexciting smaller boat which looked nothing like what we had paid for or anticipated. We were told that the water was too high for the use of the main boat, but I would have appreciating being told this in advance as it really was quite disappointing and verging on claustrophobic. I had fortunately booked a Groupon so it was not full price, but it was still a lot of money for the experience we ended up having. I don't know if it really was because the tides were too high or because there weren't enough people, but overall I was sorry that it was not a more memorable experience on the boat that I had thought we would be taking. The food was okay, but not as good as hoped for either.","April 23, 2014","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

512,"My wonderful partner booked a special dinner aboard one of Le VIP Paris's yachts to celebrate my birthday. I've always thought that you should be wary when something explicitly calls itself 'luxury' or 'VIP' and, unfortunately, this experience did not prove me wrong. The initial tickets were very, very expensive but did not include any drinks apart from a glass of (mediocre) champagne on arrival. When we asked for tap water we were told that we would have to buy a bottle as the boat's water was untreated. Except, one bottle of Evian water cost 8 euros! I also couldn't help wondering what it was the staff were drinking--not to mention how they could possibly run a hotel on a boat with untreated water... Unfortunately the water was just the start of it. The rose that every woman received constituted another additional cost, despite it being of a poor quality (and, if I'm honest, tacky if you consider that every woman in the room was given the exact same thing...). The wines were all sold by the half-bottle, rather than glasses, meaning that you were forced to spend a lot if you wanted a drink with your meal. Whatsmore, the wine seemed very overpriced--I think the cheapest HALF bottle was 25 euros. After arriving we waited an hour and 45 minutes for our food to be served--no doubt a deliberate ploy to encourage customers to order a drink to pass the time (and perhaps an attempt to get you too drunk to taste the food properly). A member of staff kept shoving a camera in our faces asking to take photos but it was not made clear that we would be charged for these too. Needless to say, we eventually capitulated after much harassment and then got charged a ridiculous amount of money for some average photos--some of which were even duplicates that had just been re-printed in black and white or sepia. At the end of the meal we were asked if we fancied a coffee--again, it wasn't made clear that this would cost additional money--and ended up being charged 4 euros PER espresso. It is a shame that an experience that claims to be about luxury actually just felt like a tacky, gimmicky experience where Le VIP Paris tried to extract as much money out of us as possible. Everything from the decor and food to the staff and service was, at best, mediocre but the prices were sky-high. We could have had a wonderful meal at a Michelin starred restaurant for the same money and all I could think was that my partner--who had tried to do something so wonderfully romantic for me--had just been ripped off. Please, please avoid--it really isn't classy and it's terrible value for money. Men, if you're thinking of booking this, don't-- get your lady the most beautiful bunch of flowers, take her out for a meal at a traditional French bistrot and then take her on one of the bateaux mouches at night (you know, the ones that cost like 10 euros a ticket). Much more romantic and much more original.","March 31, 2014","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

513,"I visited the yacht for a romantic dinner cruise on last weekend as a surprise for my Husband for our 10 year anniversary.Having looked at lots of different companies offering the Seine river dinner cruise, I decided to book with VIP as the yacht itself looked lovely and for the grand panoramic venues. Being our 10 year anniversary I wanted the wow factor and something special. Instead we were ushered from the VIP Yacht to a smaller boat for our cruise. I was told that because the water was too high we could not travel on the yacht boat. If this was the case then I feel guests should have been informed in advance or the cruise cancelled.This smaller boat look like it had been quickly converted into a restaurant. I was given a very small table facing the window. In-front of me was a large frame blocking my view. The boat looked nothing like the pictures on your website.Once back on the boat, I spoke to other couples and they too were disappointed. I also discovered everyone else had booked through Groupon except me. I feel like because everyone had paid a discounted price, we all received a discounted and poorer service and quality in food. It took over 30 minutes to order a drink and that was after requesting a menu as we seemed to not have one on our table. My vegetarian starter was poor and consisted of cold pasta shells and few salad leaves. This was okay for a starter but my main dish was appalling. Firstly it was cold, it appeared that the chef had just cooked a few vegetables and thrown it together on my plate with the same creamy mash sauce used on my starter dish. The deserts were nice.Overall we both had a very disappointing experience, and will remember our anniversary for all the wrong reasons. I would no longer revisit your hotel or recommend the dinner cruise to other friends.","February 3, 2014","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

The superior room cabin was very comfortable though small, the bathroom was bigger than on most boats, there was a tv in the room and the heating worked very well. If too warm, there was a wide window that could be opened. The cabin was soundproof and we had a view of the river (cabin n°8).The dinner was good with big portions, drinks flowed freely and the music for dancing was great too.The staff was friendly and the cruise along the river while dinner was being served gave an added touch of uniqueness to the whole event.The price though quite expensive (+/-€800)seemed in keeping with New Year's eve outings. It included for two persons, the car park, hotel night, dinner, DJ music & unlimited drinks. We stayed one night and did not take the brunch which was a whopping €55 per person.

515,"My wife and I were on our honeymoon and booked this trip well in advance. What could be better than a dinner cruise on the Seine! The cruise was formal and the food was excellent. We had wine with our lamb dinner and it was cooked perfect. We enjoyed cruising by the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, etc. We took our own pictures during the courses and even got some photos from their photographer with the Eiffel Tower in the background. They took plenty of pictures and we decided to purchase a few. We couldn't have been happier how they turned out.The back end of our honeymoon was a couple nights in Amsterdam. Throughout the 10 day honeymoon, we had purchased many items and decided to ship them back to the United States. We wanted to make sure the pictures would not bend or crease in our luggage, so they went into the shipping box with artwork we had purchased. Needless to say, our box arrived without the pictures or artwork. We were devastated! We contacted all parties involved, but to no avail. Again, we were devastated!I decided to email VIP Paris about the possibility they still had our photos on file. I explained our story about the pictures being stolen and if there was any chance they had them, I would surprise my wife and order them. I dealt with the Director of Operations who gladly told me he would reprint the photos, but I would have to contact UPS to pick the photos up. I established the account and the photos were picked up and delivered to the United States in 5 days! I can't tell you how elated we were to see the pictures again!! It made my wife's day!

516,"I'm writing this review based on the experience I had in November/December 2012, so things could have changed.I booked to go on the trip in August 2012, for a Sunday in November 2012 for my partner's 40th birthday celebration. The trip was confirmed and I paid for it. A couple of weeks before going on the trip, I reconfirmed our reservation and checked the dress code. We turned up on the agreed date and time to find the yacht unlit and with no one on it. We rang the number we were given on the booking documents and surprise surprise no one answered. The security guard working next door asked us what we were doing and when we showed him our booking documents, he advised us that there was no trip running. He then offered to check this for us and rang VIP Paris who confirmed the trip was cancelled. We were obviously extremely disappointed and so the next day I rang VIP Paris. They explained that they had sent a cancellation notice to me (I rechecked my emails and there was nothing) and that they could move my reservation or refund the money. I asked for a refund and thought that was the end of it. As it transpires, I had to email my request (even though it was their mistake) and send chasers, to be told we need your bank details again. I was told the money would be paid in 5 days, but it never arrived, so in the end I got my French colleague to ring VIP Paris and find out what was going on & tell them in no uncertain terms that I was annoyed. A few days later the money arrived - all in all it took 4 weeks to get a refund!If you are going to use this company, then I'd be very careful and check the day before you are due to go on your trip that it is actually running.","May 8, 2013","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

522,"Upon arrival, staff received us with a genuine smile (are we really in Paris?), and started to feel the welcoming atmosphere on board. I was invited to personalize the ambiance by ordering some little extras like a magnificent bouquet of red roses, chilled champagne in the cabin (next time I need to think of the strawberries!), and something I think was a “Lovebox” containing some surprises from a brand called Bijoux Indiscrets. Thanks for the advice, this little plus made a difference.I appreciated the privacy and comfort of the boat and our cozy cabin overlooking the Seine River, the confortable double bed, all equipped with shower and sanitary. Don’t expect a 100m2 hotel room – you are probably in the wrong place – but you get a real luxury Yacht comfort experience. For dinner, we had a table for two on the Seine with the possibility to walk around on deck during our meal. Quality of the meal was aligned with our expectations, and we just loved the chocolate dessert in duo. No need to describe our night onboard, the thing you need to know is that staff really cares about your intimacy, and that it was very … romantic :-) Waking up with the sound of the water lapping was very relaxing, too.VIP is of easy access, and if you really want to leave for a while you may find plenty of nearby walking and cultural activities: Bibliothèque François Mitterand, the Cour Saint Emilion, the Botanical Gardens, Chinatown and Mouffetard, among others. During the trip we could see monuments we would otherwise just ignore while strolling around in a city I thought I already knew well enough.I believe this is a unique and original service in Paris, which made me (us!) have a romantic moment in a different way. Overall, a Quality experience I would be willing to repeat.","April 17, 2012","9    Le VIP Paris Yacht Hotel

524,"My husband and traveled to Paris to attend a black tie wedding, and Hotel Edgar was on the list of recommended hotels. We picked it because we dislike large hotels and prefer more the ""local experience"" when traveling, away from the tourists. This hotel was totally what we wanted. Also, we had a few requests to prep for the event ( hair appt, clothes pressing) and the staff was wonderful with helping us. Breakfast was great and relaxing to sit outside on the plaza. Had a couple meals at the restaurant which were delicious and full of colliding flavors. Rooms are small, clean and comfortable. Typical size for a big city hotel, and we were out most of the time exploring. Short walk to the metro station, just a few blocks.Note: the neighborhood is a spiderweb of streets, so it took us a couple days to get our bearings. Tip: Some friends had problems with taking a taxi to the location since there is a similar named hotel on the east bank. Be sure to provide the taxi driver a detailed address before you start your journey, or just use Uber.","July 12, 2019","10    Hotel Edgar

The rooms are admittedly small but VERY comfortable and all you need for a short stay . I asked to see a number of rooms and they were all quirky and interesting . This is not the Ritz but neither is the price but I would rather stay in this buzzy young admosphere than be mollycobled in a museum . It overlokks a small square with practically no traffic and there are outside seats and tables for drinks prior to dinner or lunch . There were practically no tourists staying there which is a blessing , lots of little groups of 30/40 ish people discussing buisness and politics . It was a delight and the food and wine was very good . i shall certainly stay again .","April 3, 2019","10    Hotel Edgar

The hotel is on a quiet street, around the corner from the fantastic Frenchie wine bar and walking distance from the Marais. The restaurant is nice but it’s not open every evening. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. The one thing to be aware of is that the rooms are small (but not by Parisian standards). If you need more space, get the XL room. And there is a narrow stairway leading to the rooms. The staff will help, but it is a bit difficult if you have tons of luggage.

I had a double room with shower, vanity and wc (no bath). The room itself was small but clean and neat, and had everything you may need. Linen clean.The hotel is above a restaurant which does get a little rowdy at night, which was made slighty worse by the fact, that due to technical issues with my Air Conditioning, I had to sleep with the window open. It would be quieter if the window was closed, but the noise may still get to some, so something to be aware of.Breakfast was fresh and tasty yet basic and was served in the restaurant below.All in all, it is a great spot, in a quiet corner, off one of the busier Boulevards in Paris.

They even upgraded us just because. From what we were told by the super friendly staff, each room is decorated differently and has a theme. There are dozens of restaurants and cafes 3 minutes away.The only negative observation I have is not about the hotel, but about the closest metro station.

Even though the hotel restaurant had long queues on most evenings, the wait staff took time to explain to me (in English) details about each and every menu item, and offered me small tastings of dishes so I could make informed menu selections. The hotel, like many in Europe, has small rooms, accessible by stairs. The rooms are kept up impeccably, and sounds from cafe do not carry to the sleeping facilties. The closest metro stop is a five minute walk. The neighborhood is comprised of a healthy mix of various shops with some nefarious characters, but it added to the charm of the experience.

540,"Good review first...the staff was amazingly friendly for Paris!Unfortunately, that is the only good thing about this place. The location is just awful. As a single woman traveler, I simply did not feel safe walking to / from this hotel to the major sights. Loads of sex shops, peep shows and prostitutes around the hotel, and dodgy looking shops and nothing else. It was very quiet, but in an unsettling way. The room itself was a wood paneled one {the one in pictures on this site}, which felt more like I was staying at a friend's cabin, than a hotel. Very ""cold"" feeling and uncomfortably small and bare. Not worth the money at all. I would classify this as a youth hostile, NOT a hotel. I definitely won't ever be back. Made my stay in Paris very stressful and just awful. Spend the extra money and stay at a mid- range hotel in the 5th or 6th. You'll thank me.","September 13, 2015","10    Hotel Edgar

544,I've been traveling to Paris for work quite frequently and my usual hotels were booked this trip. I decided to try out Hotel Edgar based on a recommendation from a colleague. It's a boutique hotel with a great restaurant/bar on the lower level which was always full when I arrived 'home' from work. The staff is fantastic and happy to accommodate to the best of their ability - especially Alexandra and Xavier.The room I stayed in (6) had a muted elegant feel and was a great size for my 4-night stay. The wifi was also great - probably the best I've experienced in a Paris hotel. The only downside - my room was right above the outdoor seating area so it was a little noisy until the crowd died down.I enjoyed my stay and will be staying again!,"June 24, 2015","10    Hotel Edgar

547,"This is real hidden gem as this hotel, with a deep modern vintage personality, is facing a small square in the 2nd arrondissement in Paris, that is giving you the feeling to be more in a French village than in Paris (this is a plus ) You are few steps away from Les Halles as Bastille, still when sitting outside the lovely bar and restaurant and enjoying their not obvious selection of food and drinks, you might get lost in the imagines of a peaceful retreat away from city bustles .Everything in this structure has been done, I guess, expressly to show the imperfection of an old structure smartly converted in a trendy destination . Floors are uneven , rooms ( I was staying in a standard room) small sized (as unfortunately typical in Paris) but not as small as you can find somewhere lese. Decor played on pastel tones with touched of colours in line with the current decor styles, touches of modernariat everywhere, nice lamps and good bathroom with quality tolietries . Bed confortable and king sized . All staff are attentive and uncompicated , this is not a place for people looking for formalism , A nice new adress to be put on the list of those willing more personality than standardism Good price value, wifi working perfectly and free of charge , lively crowd at the bar in the evening close to two underground stations both reachable within few minutes, the area is also packed with bars and whatever needed to make your stay even more pleasantHip and cool .

So different to what we expected, so much better than what we expected. they have a bar and restauramt downstairs. We ate there the ifrst night, and the food was amazing.

The place was buzzing and it was good to be part of it. When we went to our room, there was no discernible noise despite overlooking the mainrestaurant area. The air conditioning could do with some more oomph for the comfort of us more, well nourished fellows but that is a minor issue. Location wise, you're in a comfortable 15-20 minute ramble to much of historic Paris. Nearest Metro is 5 minutes away. Other reviews say the hotel isn't cheap but if you want cheap don't go to Paris. Is it value for money? Absolutely. We would happily stay there again.","June 9, 2014","10    Hotel Edgar

The room was very clean an superbly decorated. I've stayed in Paris quite some times, and this hotel is by far the best. The manager was incredibly friendly, as well as the staff. An excellent choice. This hotel definitely added value to our city trip. The neighbourhood isn't the best you can find, but subways are close and if you walk for five minutes, you enter a nicer area. It shouldn't be a blocking issue. The hotel itself is a feature!Thanks to the staff and the managers for opening a funky and nice hotel in Paris.

565,"Stayed here for a few nights in May. What a really nice hotel! The rooms are small, but that is pretty much standard for Paris (unless you plan to spend a small fortune for your hotel).The pros:The room was perfectly clean on arrival and this standard was maintained by housekeeping every day. The room also had a very ‘’new’’ feel to it.The staff were really friendly and made us feel welcome. Additionally, they were always helpful. For example, we had an issue with our shower (one of the knobs wasn’t working) at about 10 pm one night. I went downstairs and informed the manager. About 10 minutes later he showed up and repaired it personally. I found the location really nice and very practical. You’ve got 3 different subway stations within a 5-6 minute walk (Sentier being the most practical in my opinion). Also you are only a about a 5-minute walk away from the Rue Montorgueil and all of its nice restaurants, bars, and cafes.Also, the restaurant/bar at Edgar is very nice and opened relatively late. It is a very nice place to sit down and have a few drinks to relax after a day of doing the sites in Paris. Again, the staff are very friendly.The cons:I didn’t really have any. If I were being hyper critical I would say that if you are very hungry that the restaurant may not get the job done as the vast majority of the menu is tapas and might leave you still hungry. However, as I said above, you are 5 minutes away from loads of restaurants and cafés along Rue Montorgueil.As for the reviewer who called the area ‘’seedy’’, frankly the only part of the area that might fit this description would be the area around Rue St. Denis / Blvd. St. Denis intersection, which is not right next to the hotel and is an area that you probably will not even see unless you need to go to the Strasbourg St. Denis subway station. And frankly, it wasn’t that seedy.All in all, I would certainly recommend this hotel. You are not very likely to find a hotel with Edgar’s combination of cleanliness, friendliness, and proximity to metro stations for this price.","June 11, 2013","10    Hotel Edgar

566,"Paris is expensive and you might have to pay +200 EUR/night, just to stay in a hotel room that is super small and has old furniture, BUT NOT HERE! Oh, what a treat this hotel was. The price is excellent for what you get, the staff is very friendly and helpful, the room had a more than decent size for Paris and everything was so clean (not a given unfortunately, so I have to spell it out here)! Regarding helpfulness of staff for instance: One of the shower knobs regulating the temperature was not working, we called down and within 10 minutes everything was fixed. Uncomplicated, speedy, friendly. Also, I would love to try all of their rooms since every room is different and was designed by a different designer (duo). This was the original reason why I wanted to stay at this hotel. We were in a room named ""Fran by Dave"" Other reasons to stay here:- Several metro stations very close by (2 minutes of walking)- Notre Dame, Louvre in walking distance. Go to Rue Montorgueil, about 2 minutes from the hotel. There are cheese stores, butchers, fish market places, fruit stands, cafe's, restaurants, pharmacies, etc.- Restaurant/Bar at Hotel Edgar: We had tapas once and the food quality was excellent, the ham was melting in your mouth, it was so tender....it also explains the price which was quite high, but this is Paris and quality was excellent! It was nice to have a bar there, we walked so much during the day, it was nice to unwind at the restaurant, have some drinks and go upstairs just fall asleep immediately.- Also, this hotel is tucked away several tiny streets from the main roads, so it is calm and not as crowded.I loved this place and will recommend it, or even better: Stay there again myself!","June 1, 2013","10    Hotel Edgar

The bed was comfortable, the fireplace(not a working one) was charming, and in addition to a table and chairs to have breakfast on, there was a cozy little settee. The large windows opened easily and let in a nice breeze. There was an excellent view of the dome of Saint-Augustin church, from our fifth floor room, and the French flag flying in the distance. There is a metro(9 line) station a 3 minute walk from the front door. We had a great experience here. I’d stay here again. · The street was noisy with the windows open.

This is located very close to metro/bus stand and makes it easy to go anywhere. Though we had a good time there (whatever time we spent) until we met one of the caretakers (gentleman who takes care of the property in the night). This gentleman is not only extremely rude but unreasonable and insensitive. We were returning with good memories from Paris but this person lived upto the french reputation (as generally known here).

This quirky little hotel served our needs very well - the room was spacious (the hallway, staircase, elevator and entrance to room number 14 were not, but that`s part of the charm!). The windows were very effective at keeping road noise down, and you could open them to hear the bustle of the city if you wanted to. The bathroom was very modern and shower quite roomy, though the drain couldn`t keep up - we learned quickly to shower in minute long bursts or have to towel the floor.Continental Breakfast was generous and arrived promptly when asked for (they usually asked when they saw you the day before). We bought too much food for a picnic lunch and they put the food in the fridge for us overnight, and chilled the wine we brought!The staff was bilingual and was happy to help with directions and restaurant suggestions.I actually shorted us a day on the initial booking, and my wife caught it - called them a week later and they honoured the price and let us stay in the same room!

582,"I am a little taken aback by the glowing reviews of this hotel. I think it is fair to say it is a two-star hotel in every sense of the word, and if you are expecting services of any kind, forget it. Do some people just care that there's a bed and an included breakfast? I suppose so, and the price I booked certainly seemed reasonable considering how expensive Paris is. But...the hotel is in need of freshening. The rooms were not as clean as they could've been: grungy remote control, crumbs in the cupboard, stained rugs and chairs. The bed, which I didn't sleep in, had a thin mattress and minimal bedding. The antiques looked more like thrift shop finds, but again, the rooms were larger than expected, and there was a kind of charm to the old-fashioned turnkeys and the nook-and-cranny hallways.We checked in and were shown to our room via a elevator so small you could barely squeeze in with your luggage, one person at a time. It was creaky but I had been forewarned and it contributed to the historical feel of the hotel. When we got to the room, we found one bed; we needed two. We were shown another room; same thing, one bed. I checked my reservation and the manager admitted it was their error. (I had tried to communicate via email with the hotel twice before I let on the trip, and never received an answer) He offered us a second room at no charge for the night, and then he would see about adding another bed to the original room the next day. I appreciated that he offered a solution and was trying to make us happy.I don't usually stay in 4 and 5 star hotels because price is a factor for me, and since I'm the kind of traveler who doesn't spend a lot of time in the room, that's how I usually choose a place to stay. But...I do need and depend on basic services. I had fallen on this trip and wrecked my knee. When my friend asked for ice, the manager told her she needed to walk two blocks away for ice and water. Since I needed ice through the night, that wasn't going to work.We both realized we were not going to be comfortable so we chose to relocate, but it was not without a very uncomfortable discussion with the manager, and having to pay for a night because we were outside the cancellation period.I'd say if you are going for price, don't care about services, or being in a somewhat isolated area, a bit off the beaten track, then come ahead. If anything I mentioned would bother you, this hotel is not for you. I would also say, not that I've seen the hotel, and moved to another one for a better price, this place, though more affordable than some, is a bit overpriced given the state of the hotel.","November 16, 2016","11    Hotel d'Argenson

The metro stop, Miromisnel, which was just around the corner, was perfect to get to where we wished. Overall, a very comfortable stay and we would stay again, no problem.","October 21, 2015","11    Hotel d'Argenson

595,"The good:We arrived at this hotel (excellent location btw) and I was utterly charmed by the decor! We were in room number 11 on the first floor. We found it at the end of an impossibly tiny corridor. No matter, we squeezed into the room - beautiful vintage-esque furnishings in a decently spacious room (by Parisian standards). The bathroom was so small we actually started laughing. When you enter it, you have to walk sideways (crab style) since it's so tiny. Still, it was very clean. The windows open out overlooking the street, and it was nice to watch life pass by. The bad:What we didn't realise, and the front desk person definitely never mentioned, was that our room was squished between the hotel's kitchen and their office. So at the crack of dawn (literally around 5 or 6am), there was all this incredibly LOUD clanking, banging and talking (yelling) right next door from the kitchen, that lasted all the way until 11am. We were already exhausted when we'd arrived the evening before, so needless to say we didn't get to sleep in at all. I really wish the front desk person had warned us, so that we could have requested another room (even if it meant paying a bit more). I was so tired the next day! :( On the bright side though, they delivered a light breakfast to us in our room (included in the room rate). The tray consisted of fresh baguette as well as delightfully flaky croissants, with butter and jam, and tea and coffee. I'd stay here again, but only if it's in a different room. Location was very good - it's close to the metro and Gare St Lazare, plus super close to plenty of restaurants, shops, and a Monoprix.","September 15, 2015","11    Hotel d'Argenson

598,"Paris is quite expensive so there is no denying that this hotel provides good value. The rooms are large, nicely decorated and the washroom is adequate. The breakfast is good and held us over until lunch time. The location was a bit further from the Eiffel Tower and Louvre than we were expecting based on the other reviews. About a 30 minute walk to most main attractions. There is a metro station close by if you prefer not to walk which would get you to most spots rather quickly. The rooms were hot as it was the middle of July, but the fan in the room did help to keep it more comfortable. The lady we encountered at the front desk was very friendly and personable, we personslly found the two men were not as friendly or welcoming. Our stay at the hotel was good enough however, If we were to return to Paris we would likely choose something with closer proximity to the Eiffel Tower and other major attractions. Despite the likely price difference we prefer to walk as much as possible on our holidays and this was just a bit further out.","July 22, 2015","11    Hotel d'Argenson

The hotel is well located with short walking distance to Champs Elysee, Louvre or the big shopping center Galeries Lafayette. When I mean short, I think about 8-10 min walk.As we were so lucky with the weather our hole stay, we rented bikes, had a lovely picnic near the Eiffel Tower.

602," Very, very good. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. But be honest with yourself about your type of travel and expectations. If you are a budget traveler, this is a wonderful place. We stayed twice in May, once on the second floor and once on the fourth floor, as a base between trips to Venice and London and to spend a little time in Paris. Both times we had a view of Haumann and the Shakespeare bookshop. We could not have been more pleased with LOCATION. 20 minutes of walking up Hausmann to the left and you are at the Arch d’ Triumph. Walk about 20 minutes in the opposite direction (know the city well or make sure you have a map) and you are headed to Louvre and other main attractions. In spite of the busy street, both rooms were super quite with windows closed. The lower room had a lovely, small balcony. The upper room had only a widow rail, but still offered a fresh breeze when needed. Bathrooms are small, but clean. Expect a European shower and have a bar of soap (you get one small bar). Our lower room had some rug spotting, some minor paint flecking on the high ceiling. Our fourth floor room had newer rugs, bathroom tile and curtains. Beds were firm. Using curtains and shutters, you can sleep till 10:00 if you desire. But breakfast is served at the exact time you desire (within 15 minute intervals) in your room between 7 and 10. The staff speaks multiple languages, is very fluent in English and was pleasant and helpful on all shifts. We hope to return to Paris in the future and this will certainly be a place we will consider again.","May 26, 2015","11    Hotel d'Argenson

613,"1. No AC = Awesome street noiseOn a hot September night - with the wonderful floor to ceiling windows open onto a great location, there was so much noise, I tossed. First I tossed out of bed the long pillow that was to be shared by two. Then I tossed the plastic sheet that separated the mattress from the sheet from me. As I was hot and sweating - this was making the situation worse.2. Breakfast in bedWhen you see the breakfasts stacked on trays in the elevator from the floor up - you may choose to eat elsewhere....although the hot chocolate was awesome.3. Pop Up BathroomI'm sure all the rooms shared bath facilities in earlier years and these very nice, new bathrooms have popped-up inside your room. The lighting is terrible. The rainwater shower is too large for the shower stall so you will make a flooding mess. And fortunately, MonoPrix is only a block away so you can purchase some real soap and shampoo.

616,"Hotel D'argensen is is a very nice little hotel conveniently located close to all the major attractions of Paris. Rooms are adequately comfortable but have no air conditioning so could be quite hot during the warmer months. Bed comfortable but only a double so feels very small if you are used to an Australian king size. Breakfast is served in your room at a time convenient to yourself which is a nice touch and consists of juice, croissant, jams and coffee.All in all, good value for the location but with big concerns about the safety factors in the unlikely event of a fire. Although the owner assured me there are regular inspections by the local fire department it seems the regulations are not as stringent as they might be.For instance there are no smoke or heat detectors in the rooms, no sprinkler system and the thing that concerned me most was the complete absence of any means of escape.if you are on the upper floors the only option is to jump, which is not a nice position to be in if there are flames licking round your backside.It would be entirely wrong of me to single out Hotel D'argensen as the only hotel is Paris with these concerns as there are literally hundreds of similar hotels throughout the area.In conclusion Hotel D'argensen is good value and well located so a good choice, but if I were to stay again I would seek a room on the ground floor.","June 4, 2014","11    Hotel d'Argenson

It is a very Parisian hotel, a bit shabby, but with loads of charm.The hallways and doors are very narrow, the ceilings tall and decorated and the rooms have large french windows which leads out to small balconies. While not large, the room was of a decent size, and contained a wardrobe, two chairs, a small desk and a nightstand. The bathroom, although tiny, was modern and clean.The elevator is quite claustrophobic, I only used it once even though we stayed on the 5th floor... When it comes to breakfast, the croissants were some of the best that I've ever had, and it's quite nice to be in Paris and have breakfast in bed :)The location hotel is fine, the major attractions are within walking distance (if you like to walk), but the metro or bicycle is more convenient. There is a velib-station right across the street from the hotel, and I highly recommend to explore Paris on bike! The system is cheap and excellent, with hundreds of stations spread across the entire city (http://en.velib.paris.fr/).But: the hotel room was not very well clean.

I wasn't about to put my bare feet on that floor, but I am a little fussy about hotel floors in general. I didnt' notice a nasty looking brown stain on the duvet cover until the morning AFTER we'd slept under it. Luckily it was at the foot of the bed. I would say this place is adequate.

The hotel is a bit dated and the rooms are on the smaller side, but it is clean and the staff is very friendly. Again, it was all about that view!","May 21, 2019","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

627,This has a great location. Directly across the river from the louvre. Metro station about 8 minute walk. But the hotel is old. The bathroom was clean but the room felt very old. Beds were uncomfortable. When we booked we thought breakfast was included. But it was 14 euro per person. So we picked up croissants instead. We had the triple room which was three twin beds. Room was hot. We slept with the balcony doors open but traffic was loud. The place was ok but seems expensive for the quality. But again the location was excellent.,"April 26, 2019","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

629,"Cordial, professional service staff, clean room, lots of old Parisian charm, plenty of history within its walls, fantastic location for walking in a city that was made for walking. Great views of the Louvre and The Seine from the rooms, large French windows. Single room was just right for the solo traveler, small but comfortable. Staff arranged early AM transportation to CDG was great and reasonably priced. Note: when traveling in summer, bring earplugs for sleeping when windows are open, street traffic and riverboat noise is loud. Don't know about noise with windows closed but read that recent improvements included new glazing to help with street noise. Would definitely stay there again. The hotel has housed numerous famous guests from the world of literature, music, and the visual arts, from Oscar Wilde, Baudelaire, Wagner, Sibelius, Pissarro, Reidy, Hemingway, and Blondin .","April 15, 2019","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

Sleeping to the sound of the traffic was unusually calming, and omg the view. Rudolph Nuryev's apartment (has a plaque)is four doors down, and I could not get over that fact every time I looked out. The rooms are small, but cozy. The bathroom was as well. Tiny sink, no where to spread out my morning routine. The staff was welcoming and helpful, especially the gentleman who worked late afternoon, his name escapes me. He explained how to take the train to Versailles, and gave us a map that was highlighted in advance. The carpets in our hallways were pretty worn, that was the only real negative factor.

636,"Excellent location for the Louvre area!! he hotel itself has been in business for about 100 years. The building is from the 16th century and was built as an abbey. Monks resided here which is why the rooms are so petite. The floor in the bar area is original to the Abbey so be sure to take a look and appreciate. Oscar Wilde stayed in room 14 and they have had some other notable guests such as composer Wagner. We stayed in room #34 with a view of the Sienne.  This building has been purchased by an investor and will close Jan 2019 to be fully renovated into a 4 star hotel..no doubt the prices will reflect a 4 start hotel overlooking the Siene...get your stay in before then!! This hotel is blocks from the Louvre, musee de Orsay, place de la concorde, blocks from Paris City vision tours office and blocks from Paris Tourisme office. (Both of these companies book all kinds of tours from day trips to normandy to day and night boat rides on the Sienne) but it was nice to walk over and catch a bus to the Reim/Champagne area and not have to pay any extra for hotel pick up and such.We were in walking distance of Notre Dame, the Morais district...etcThe location could not be beat.The condition of the room left a little to be desired...it was kind of dingy..BUT for the price we paid, the location we were in and the absolutely romantic view of the Siene, i got over it very quickly. To open your giant windows to the street, the river and art vendors down below was like a scene out of a movie and certainly an experience i never thought i would be able to afford! I can also understand now why no fixes are being made in the building-they are going to rip it all apart in a few months to renovate..so it is not that hotel is being left to deteriorate..knowing this, i was able to forgive the conditions.The room, utilities and linens were all extremely clean.the bathroom shower has excellent hot water and excellent water pressure-i have very thick curly hair so good water pressure in the shower can make or break a trip for me!The bed was very low to the floor..maybe 2 feet off the floor. It was very comfortable. my husband and I are larger people and have back issues and found the size of the bed adequate and we did not experience any adverse effects on our backs.The street noise can be quite loud and does continue thru the night..but when the windows are closed, you hear virtually nothing. Again, we were there during very high temps so we had to leave the window open. We had such activity filled days though, that honestly, the noise didn't bother us, we were to tired, we slept thru it all.There is no building air con..only a room air conditioner which stands in the room..it was too small to make any difference..however we were there during a heat wave with temps in the 90s..and at night there was a lovely breeze coming thru the windows.They have a bar which we made use of several times, often times the only ones there..the bar tender is whomever is behind the desk.We were very impressed with Gerard at the front desk who went out of his way to provide help, information and was in general, very nice to converse with about Paris, the hotel and its history. The other front desk help was just fine, but Gerard I think really enjoys getting to know his guests.We paid extra for the breakfast option..we were unable to have breakfast 3 of the days we were there and they kindly did not charge us for that. Breakfast was served from a small menu, portions small.","August 1, 2018","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

637,"We stayed here after our marriage on June 2nd. Its location is so amazing you practically walk to everywhere you need to see when you're on a very short vacation like us. We did visit Louvre just across on Sunday, but couldn't see Musee D'Orsay which is walking distance to the hotel since most places are closed on Mondays. In this short visit we managed to have dinner in Saint Germaine, Latin Quarter, Notre Dame, Eiffel tower and walked along the Seine river. All walking distance to the hotel. This hotel has very small rooms or ours was exceptionally small, but they are clean and when you close the balcony door, very quiet. To our surprise we didn't have any mosquitos when the door was open. There is no fridge in rooms which would've been nice. We chose no breakfast package so we don't have any opinion in regards to their breakfast. The staff were adequate, but not extraordinary. They were kind enough to call us a shuttle to the airport which saved us a few euros. Since the building is from 1800's, apparently some famous composers and authors stayed in this place in the past. There are photographs of Oscar Wilde, Richard Wagner etc on walls in the lobby. Overall we were happy for the price and location and would stay in this hotel again.","July 2, 2018","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

The hotel is tired, dirty and desperately in need of a renovation especially for the prices that the rooms go for. The staff were nice and pleasant. We stayed in a double twin room which seemed to be larger than other rooms we saw. Our room faced an interior light well which although offered no Seine views was quiet. The furniture, carpet, paint and drapes were really old and thus made the room feel very dirty. We didn’t want to take our shoes off or our clothes out of the bag.

You can hear normal conversation of neighbours.The windows are pretty well insulted but when open the road noise (four lane busy road adjacent) is apparent.Consequently be cautious in the summer. No a/c so if you need ventilation at night the cost will be ability to sleep...Front desk staff general friendly apart from late night attendants.Breakfast is a bit of a joke as they can't seem to handle more than four people at a time.

It is dark, dingy and I banged my head against the ""quaint rafters of the loft"" several times. The worst hotel room experience in my 68 years for a rate of 179 Euros. I let the desk manager, Bernard, know of my extreme disappointment with the room and he told me that the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing he could do to change my room. I was staying for 19 days so I went over his head and spoke with the hotel manager. I reminded her that I was paying close to 3000 Euros for my stay and that I could find another hotel to take my money.

655,"I must preface this review by saying I do not speak French. This was important because it was my first trip to beautiful Paris, and I was anxious that I would not be able to communicate. The staff at Hotel du Quai-Voltaire could not have been more accommodating, not only with my lack of French, but also everything else.The charge was E117 per night. I stayed three nights, and pre-paid E117 when I made the reservation. Coming from New York, I thought the price was ridiculously low. If there were a hotel across the street from the Metropolitan Museum, you can be sure it would cost at least E400/night. Even before I arrived, I received from the hotel manager a survey asking how they might be of help. I was dumbfounded. Who does that? Well, they do. I knew I had made the correct choice. Some call it a ""tired"" hotel. Yes, it's been there for decades, and the drapes and bedspreads could use a change. But the staff are lovely. They really care if you are enjoying Paris or not. They are not stuffy or pretentious, but friendly and helpful.Visitors such as Baudelaire, Sibelius, Richard Wagner, and Oscar Wilde have preceded you, which was a thrill for me. You are walking into history here. The view couldn't be more inspiring. From your window you see the Louvre, the Seine in all its variable rhythms, the Pont Royal, the Pont du Carrousel. The location could not be better for museum-goers wishing to visit the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Musee de l'Orangerie, and the Tuileries. The St. Germain antiques district is right behind the hotel, with all of its magical old shops, galleries, and restaurants. I couldn't have been more delighted with the location. The staff were very kind and helpful in every way. Upon my arrival from New York, I was craving a coffee, and it was quickly made for me and served in the small bar/breakfast room. A beautiful modern glass chandelier reminiscent of flowers hangs in the tiny bar/cafe. A perfect touch in the quaint room.The staff kindly offered to arrange a shuttle back to the airport. The cost was E26 -- not bad at all. They were on time and very professional. ""The Shuttle"" it was called - 06 29 46 39 52. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.After my stay, another survey from the manager arrived in my email. They asked for an honest review. I provided it, including saying that the bed in my room was sagging a bit and needed to be replaced -- a twin bedded Room, # 25. (For only three nights, I felt I could deal with this. Had my stay been longer, I would have requested another room.)There is still a telephone on the side of the bed (!).The hotel is a gem. If you must have modern furnishings, this is not for you. But everything else considered, I don't know how you can do better in beautiful Paris.","February 15, 2017","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

657,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The location and the views cannot be beat. The staff were unbelievably welcoming and helpful. They really go out of their way for you. The rooms were far better than I expected. I usually stay in much pricier hotels, but since I knew I would have no time to spend in my room other than sleeping and showering, I decided to give this a go. Yes, the rooms are very small. I started in a regular double, which had a teeny bathroom, then decided to stay three extra days and upgraded to a superior double which was more spacious and had a nice bathroom. I found the rooms quite charming; cheery coloring, French door/windows that overlook the Seine and the Pont du Carousel - spectacular. Noiseproof windows that really work. The bed and duvet/sheets are as good as any 3-star hotel. Only the towels left a bit to be desired. Carpet a little worn, and wall hangings not exactly art, but none of this took away from the charm of the room. The hallways/stairs are pleasant. Small elevator, but who cares? I have spent much much time in Paris over the years, stayed in numerous hotels, and I can honestly say that this one is a find. It's not for those looking for pampering/luxury, but it is an unbelievably good place for the price.","December 5, 2016","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

658,"A 6 minute walk from the Orsay Rer C station - easy to get to from the airport if you use the trains. Our room was ready when we arrived shortly after 11am. It was on the fifth floor, The hall could have used a reno, but the room was bigger than I expected, clean and functional. Best of all it had a million-dollar view facing the Seine, right across the street from the Louvre. Over the next four days we would leave in the morning and arrive back at night for bed, so it was the perfect location for us and we pretty much walked everywhere – a great timesaver. I would definitely stay there again.","November 12, 2016","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

659,No it's not an international grand hotel. It is very typically French. Yes the lift is tiny but the staircase is beautiful. Rooms not large but OK.!Breakfast is simple but the bread & croissant were fresh and the juice had recently been inside oranges.

660,"The Hotel du Quai-Voltaire is across from the Louvre on the Left Bank with magnificent views of the Seine from all the windows. The location is perfect. The Louvre is across the bridge over the Seine, the D'Orsay is a short walk down the street, the Batobus is in front of the D'Orsay. It is walking distance to Notre Dame, to Boulevard Saint Germain, the Latin Quarter and rue de l'Opera to Galeries Lafayette. My husband and I have stayed there every year for 10 years or so.The rooms we have been in are not large but balconies in the rooms on the fourth floor make them seem larger. The manager and those who handle the desk are very lovely, helpful people. The reception area and restaurant are charming. It is reasonably priced and considering its advantages, it is inexpensive. I suggest checking out their website for a pretty good idea of the view and the rooms.","November 1, 2016","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

661,"I stayed at the HotelduQuaiVoltaire.com in November of 2001. I was meeting a French friend there and he, knowing the city, chose this hotel for our stay. It is located very close to the Musee d' Orsay and the Louvre, and nearby Metro stations make the entire city easily accessable. The hotel, in general, isn't lavish, but it's lovely nevertheless. Mostly I found this hotel quaint and charming, with relatively small, but clean and comfortable, rooms. Our room (as do all of the rooms in this hotel except a few) had a spectacular view of the Seine and the Louvre. The hotel is on a busy Paris street, so if you're a light sleeper, the noise may bother you. I recommend requesting a room above street level. We stayed on the 3rd floor and heard little street noise. The staff was very nice and accommodating. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, charming hotel in the moderate price range.","October 16, 2016","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

662,"We stayed for 4 nights at this 3 star hotel. A true 3 star with rooms a bit tied, double bed only and a very small lift that feels like it will break down at any time. Pricing compared to other 3 star hotels we looked at was comparable, so it is value for what you get. We normally stay 4 star but prices in Paris at that time we're very high. We paid the extra for a room overlooking the Seine and the views were a big part of the appeal for this hotel. Busy road beneath but the room was very quiet if you keep the balcony doors shut.Breakfast was limited and we just paid as we went and mostly ate elsewhere. Position is a big plus if you are new to Paris and want somewhere close to attractions and easy to get your bearings.The Louvre is at your doorstep, Musee D Orsay 100 metres away and being on the river, it is very easy to walk along to Notre Dame, across to main Avenues and around to key areas. Some day tours leave from just over the river which is another reason I booked this area.The surprising downside was the lack of shops and restaurant options in the immediate area. Yes, walk 10-15 minutes and you find more options but after a long day of walking, there were few good priced options really close by.Transport options were okay with Metro lines within walking distance but like the restaurants, 10 minutes to connecting Metro lines.Overall it was fine for 3 star levels at the price offered.If you want lots of food and shopping options and are willing to pay extra, there are probably better areas to go to. If you want to soak up the Louvre, the river and the parks in the centre, this is the place then. Good value for what we paid for..","October 8, 2016","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

664,"Husband and I stayed here September 7-13, third Paris trip. We've stayed in 1st before and wanted to try the Rive Gauche this time. Also we sought a hotel with Seine views and came across HQV. Thanks to TA, I felt we knew exactly what we were getting. And we liked it even better. It is only 30-some rooms, and older, a quirky layout maybe (saw it was a convent in mid-1800s). And reviews said very small, tiny lift, creaky floors, no room service, etc. Size-wise it may not work for some or those who need amenities. But oh, those VIEWS! Just breathtaking. Kept pinching myself that I was seeing the Seine, Louvre, and Tuileries from our hotel windows. We had a regular room with Queen bed (not Superior room that's slightly bigger with balcony) but it was large enough for us and the windows fully opened to window rail for the breeze, sights, and sounds. (May not be ideal for small children). And the street noise was loud, yet with windows shut at night (no AC, though), it was muffled enough to sleep fine. We booked it almost a year ahead or as soon as we could, via Expedia as to have a third party, but we could have just booked through the hotel. I contacted them several times with questions and then a last-minute confirmation of our room (I absolutely wanted to confirm in writing that we had a Seine view as I believe there may be a few rooms that do not) and someone replied in English within minutes every time. Impressive. We arrived about 8 am on September 7 via taxi from CDG and our room was not ready, which we didn't expect. So we left our luggage and walked to Tuileries, then Notre Dame and the Isles, and checked in finally about 1 pm. We found the manager Madame to be most charming and the staff at the desk always friendly and helpful--with recommendations, maps, directions, and booking our airport return taxi. Our room was very clean, bathroom nice--newer, and housekeeping service prompt. We took the lift to go up to 3 (4th US floor) and the wide staircase to descend. The hotel is a block from Musee D'Orsay and across the river from the Louvre, of course. We were just thrilled with the location and overwhelmed by the views. We would love to return some day and would happily stay again at the HQV. We felt like we were really experiencing the heart of Paris.","September 21, 2016","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

Though we faced a very busy road along the river Seine (which was in flood at the time), the noise was not problem at all. The view was good. The location is excellent with the Louvre and D'Orsay very close. Good restaurants within and easy walk in a safe and quiet area despite a Medical Uni nearby. The area around the hotel has many art dealer businesses which were decorated with beautiful roses as part to the Art Trail on while we were there. There was a supermarket not far away.

670,"This was to be our fourth visit to the Hotel du Quai Voltaire, which we had booked six months in advance and prepaid. We looked forward to the wonderful view across the Seine, the picnics made up of the best charcuterie from the rue des Martyrs to be enjoyed in our room. We were unprepared for the changes: a dangerous tiny shower, filthy rooms and halls, the elusive manager, and the frightened staff. We were shown to room 53 on the sixth floor (cinqieme etage). It was smaller than our previous rooms on the lower floors, had only a tiny box of a shower, no bathroom light, dirty carpets, wooden planks over radiators for shelves. We immediately asked for a room with a bathtub and two beds. The receptionist said he could do nothing unless we accepted a room with a tiny double bed. He said the manager would have to deal with this. Where was she? She hadn’t arrived. She was in a business meeting and could not be disturbed. She had left.When we examined the room further, we saw a sign: It is expressly forbidden to bring food or drink into the room. Next to this was a lengthy room service menu from their failing restaurant. What an insult!When it was clear that the staff would do nothing and the manager had made herself scarce, we attempted to use the shower. It was slippery, very slippery. A towel had to be laid down to prevent a fall. There was nowhere to put soap or shampoo, and there was nothing to hold on to except the plumbing fixtures.The water overflowed the shallow sides and flooded the bathroom.I asked the receptionist why, when we booked on their website months ahead we had been given the worst room on the dirtiest floor. He could only refer me to the missing manager. We left after the second night, losing one night’s prepayment. We found a better, safer, cleaner hotel.","June 14, 2016","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

The view from the bedroom overlook the Seine and the musee d'orsay is less than a 5 minute walk (it also connects to the metro as well). I think, however, it was probably the only positive thing about the place. Well, that and the breakfast. Their breakfast is pretty good.CONS: The bedroom is rather old. The floor felt uneven in places and it ""creaked"" when stepped on. If that bothers you, then you might want to consider staying somewhere else. There is a no food no drink policy for the rooms. Being from out of town, and a first time Paris visitor, I felt this rule was a bit unwelcoming. I wasn't impressed by the service either. From the first day to the last, I never really felt welcomed. It always seemed as if we were bothering whoever worked behind the front counter. If I didn't have to return the room key every time I left the building, I would just avoid them entirely.","May 5, 2016","12    Hotel du Quai-Voltaire

690,"Since I like almost everything about this .hotel, it is surprising that I rate it only a 3 out of 5. The problem is that the really unpleasant thing takes the shine off the rest: the way they bundle the evening meal as part of the package. As far as I can tell, there is no way around this, and the meals, in a mediocre restaurant (L'Entracte) down the street from the hotel, are definitely not desirable--but I'll not go into a lot of detail on that. Otherwise the hotel is quite good. The staff is helpful, pleasant, and multilingual; the lobby area is attractive; the room I have is also attractive and clean and quiet; the hotel is very well located; the breakfasts (fortunately in the hotel itself) are copious, varied, fresh, and the coffee is good. But since you can't stay here without paying for dinners you'll never eat, I guess this will be my only stay at the Manufacture.","April 7, 2019","13    Hotel La Manufacture

It's tucked away from the big avenues, so provides a bit quieter environment.The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room I stayed in was rather small - typical for Paris - and overall reasonably comfortable. The only criticism I have is about the poor insulation from the street, specifically the windows that left big gaps for the cold air to get in and create the drafts, despite the cranked up heating. Otherwise, I was rather pleased with my stay at La Manufacture.","December 21, 2018","13    Hotel La Manufacture

The room and bathroom were quite compact but this wasn't an issue for me as I stayed alone and only for one night. I would not suggest booking the 'Classic Room' with the double bed for a couple as it would be very difficult to fit two suitcases in the room with enough space to walk around. The balcony was a really nice addition. The staff were so friendly and helpful at all hours of the day and night. The buffet breakfast was awesome! Great location too and felt like a safe area. Closeby to some wonderful restaurants and a really beautiful little area called Buttes-Chaumont - recommend this area for easy access to the metro but with fewer tourists for a more authentic Parisian experience.","December 18, 2018","13    Hotel La Manufacture

717,"Extremely inadequate for 3 stars. The staff were helpful to the best of thier abilities given the constraints of inadequate staffing in the evening. When we first arrived, the toilet lid was broken but they found someone to come up and fix it after originally saying that we'd have to wait until the next morning. The room didn't have a lot of natural light and looked directly into offices.The lack of minibar/fridge was unacceptable. The amount of space required for 2 people was not sufficient and could barely fit the cases - especially since it was supposed to be above the basic size (the Comfort traditional) and we had needed the extra space as I was staying with my mother who doesn't pack light. The fact that the bar was closed in the evening as there was no staff to man it is ridiculous as that is when most people want to use it. The lack of space in the bathroom made it uncomfortable to have toiletries in there or clothing for after the shower. There was not adequate storage for clothes except for a tiny wardrobe that didn't allow you to access most items behind the front hanger. There was a nasty smell of sewage coming from the bathroom - especially in the mornings - throughout our stay even though we reported it and they said that they would check it out (the solution was to open the windows). We had to go down to the lobby to pick up and carry our order of coffee ourselves as well as the ironing board and iron even though there's supposed to be room service. The bedroom itself was clean and the bed was comfortable but the shower curtain had yellowing on the inside which can be disconcerting when it's by your face and you don't know what it is. Also the shower head could not go straight as the hose did not have enough space to fit between the pole and the wall. It could be hand-held so it could be managed. Although it doesn't sound like it, I don't like being so negative which is why we didn't complain about the size of the room and the shower situation. However, the staff didn't seem to have a lot of autonomy to make decisions for themselves so it felt like a waste of breath to complain. The location was nice in that there was a shopping center close by and the town hall around the corner meant that we saw a lot of weddings in our 3 days there. It was also convenient to the Metro. In conclusion, extremely disappointing especially in comparison to the hotel that we had stayed in the previous week which was also a 3 star hotel (The Hotel du Continent). I had booked La Manufacture after seeing all of the great reviews on trip advisor and am frankly completely perplexed by the difference in experiences.","September 16, 2018","13    Hotel La Manufacture

718,"I had booked my room on booking.com. Upon checkin, I was asked to pay the entirety of three nights’ stay upfront (even though they already had my credit card number as guarantee: vive la confiance!). Luckily, I asked to see the room first, which was small, dirty and right next to a noisy lift. I then asked for it to be changed, in vain, as they were fully booked. The night manager was not even able to guarantee that the room would be changed the day after. I then chose not to check in and asked the front office to cancel my reservation. The staff member accepted to do so but my credit card was charged for the entire sum, and I only got it back through booking.com. This is an abusive, dishonest conduct, unworthy of a three star hotel. Beware of management, therefore, and of substandard rooms. The location, however, is good and the building quite nice (not the rooms though).","September 11, 2018","13    Hotel La Manufacture

731,"When I booked my reservation, it was after much research and deliberation as trying to book a hotel in Paris can be overwhelming, even after visiting for years. It is not uncommon to pay a lot, for little in return in terms of service and actual hotel. But, I was pleasantly surprised by the Hotel de Suede. Upon my arrival, I was given a room where I felt that my request for a quiet area was honored. I'm a very light sleeper, and I could still hear door slams, but overall between the location and a consistent white noise of the air conditioner, I was very grateful. The room itself was apparently kept by a staff who understands how important it is for guests to feel like they're in a managed, clean space. This is not a given regardless of what one pays. But, for me, what or I should say whom won me over the most was whom I can only assume was at the least, the General Manager. Before even knowing he was the GM, he greeted this tired traveler with a kind and sincere smile. I know this sounds unimportant, but when one is far away from home, and is hoping the place one is staying in, can be at least remotely comforting, feeling welcomed is priceless. Having traveled extensively and having had the opposite experience at times, his demeanor towards his guests was very much appreciated. At one point, my dress got caught on a loose nail on the desk in my room. I alerted the young lady at the front desk and she was also very empathetic and told me she'd speak to her superior to see if they could help me fix my dress. After being out for a good portion of the day, not only did she remember me when I returned, but she had also spoken to her superior who I then found out was the same kind man who on my first day of arrival where I certainly looked tired and disheveled, he made me feel welcomed. He said he could see the next day if someone on his staff could help me fix my dress, yet when I alerted him of my early departure, he said that he was sorry nothing more could be done, but that I could be comped with a free breakfast for the inconvenience. While I now still have to pay for my dress to be repaired, I appreciated the gesture of the breakfast as he could have just brushed me off since I was leaving early and just be discounted as a dispensable tourist as do so many places that cater to tourists. An added gesture would have been to offer to pay the bill for the repair back home, but I can understand that this is tricky as it would require an honor system that unfortunately others might abuse, so an on the spot solution is preferable for the establishment and I can respect that. I chose this hotel because of it's proximity to the Miraculous Medal Chapel, after the reviews and fair price in comparison to other area hotels. Yes, it's small, yes it's a little out of the way for some areas, but it's really difficult to find a hotel in Paris that is equidistant to everything, and worthy of one's business, unless you stay in a houseboat on the Seine. I would encourage you to stay here because the GM makes you feel like your business is appreciated, like you as a person are respected and because the rooms are well kept and inviting. Don't stay here if you will complain about size. It's Paris. If you want big rooms, you have to look at hotels that cater to that as a non-negotiable. But, if you can adapt to the French respect of older architecture, without sacrificing modern needs, this is the place to stay. They make great use of the space that's available to them, in great and successful attempts to cater to the needs of their guests. Thank you, Hotel de Suede. May you continue to run successfully for many years to come.","July 4, 2019","14    Hotel de Suede St. Germain

Good location and close to Rue de Bac, which is a charming street with cafes, shops. I did not have the breakfast, so can't comment on that. This is not 5 star, but I still really enjoyed it and would go back. The room was mostly quiet, but I did hear the people walking heavy above me, and some banging and thumping during the day.

737,Great location. Convenient for Rodin and Orsay museums. Good selections at breakfast. Comfortable beds.Front desk staff gave poor directions multiple times. Sent us to the Orsay museum when we asked for Rodin.2 different people at the front desk told me several times that we did not pay for breakfast and later realized that we did. They did not apologize for their error. One morning we had a tour booked at 0700 so we did not have time for breakfast which started at 0700. We were told we could not have a refund; so we asked if we could take some croissants to go We finally got them after 0700 and we were late for our tour. We asked for water as the breakfast area was out. They gave us 4 small bottles and then added 13 euro to our bill! No wash clothes in the rooms. Hotel could use a refresh. I booked two adjoining rooms and was told they don't have that. They could only give us two rooms next to each other. This is a HUGE disappointment as I booked adjoining not next to!! Adjoining means there is a door in between!,"April 20, 2019","14    Hotel de Suede St. Germain

Our clean room was just off the quiet courtyard and was furnished pleasantly with plenty of wardrobe space. Breakfast was served in a dining area and was of the self service continental variety. What stood out for me was the service we received. On check in,we were warmly greeted by the receptionist, told where the nearest metros were and provided advice on local restaurants when asked. Further advice was happily provided whenever we asked during our stay. In addition the way that a situation was handled, involving the deposit on a lost safe key which we found in our luggage when we returned home a week after we checked out of the hotel, restored my faith that there are people who know the value of good service.Thank you.

I was checking out the next morning so decided to give the safe lock back the previous night, and explained to the guy at the reception that it will be a busy morning trying to get to the airport, kids, luggage, taxi etc. The guy told me to return it in the morning and then said in a condescendingly “how hard is it to return it in the morning”..... I explained to him that I will be in a rush, two kids, luggage, etc...and will not have time and may forget.

Our flight was cancelled due to a mechanical problem and we missed our two nights here- they refused to provide a refund/ somewhat understandable but what truly bothered me was that due to our flight changing we were in Paris at the end of our trip instead- they wouldnt even entertain the idea of shifting the reservation to the nights at the end of our trip. I even reached out to the site that I booked with, who tried to talk to themOn our account and the hotel was steadfast and not even expressing understanding at our situation- which was out of our control.

The hotel location was ok, room was nicely decorated and spacious, the bathroom was modern and large for Paris, and the staff were generally knowledgeable and friendly. The breakfast was a very good quality continental breakfast buffet that was overpriced at 15 Eu each, but there is an excellent Boulangerie around the corner for a fraction of that cost. The rooms on the street side are noisy. We stayed 8 nights and left unhappy about the thefts,and the attitude that I had lost the phone.

750,So the room is typical size for a Parisian hotel. But first impressions in the lobby are not great. It looks tired and a little uncoordinated and lacking that French style. The room I had was the noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in. You could hear every word the people above me were saying and footsteps and doors closing were really loud.

My room was unusually large for Parisian hotels and my bathroom had been recently refurbished. The décor was classic shabby chick – something Parisians pull off with aplomb, my bed was comfortable and clean. If I had a complaint it would be the attitude of the night porter whom I woke up every night at 0200hrs when I returned from work. I think he was surprised at the hours my team were working.

The hotel staff were very helpful. They have maps of the city to give to you and they will give suggestions if you need them. The first day, we walked to the Eiffel Tower. On the way back, I bought some very fragrant cheese and ate some when we got back to the room. It was very fragrant, and everyone in the room was complaining, so I opened up the window in the bathroom and stuck it out on the ledge. It was in December and it was very cold outside, but the room was very warm and comfortable. There is a great brasserie down around the corner - we went every morning for coffee and croissants, etc. One day, we bought sandwiches there to take with us for lunch. There are also two pharmacies, one on either side of the hotel. It is also situated between two Metro stations, and there is a huge MonoPrix close by, and there was a church with a market where they were selling flowers, cheese, baked goods, jams, and soap.

There is also a FranPrix store (like an American convenience store) just a couple of blocks away for some drinks or snacks, or a bottle of wine.","July 30, 2016","14    Hotel de Suede St. Germain

765,Location is pretty central and within easy commute. Small hotel but staff are very friendly and helpful. Only criticism we would make is the taxi service offered for the airport does not make it clear that you will stop and multiple hotels to pick up passengers. The taxi arrived early for us (we were ready - but did miss breakfast) Other passengers were not ready which meant we had to wait for them. The other passengers were departing from various terminals which meant on arriving at the airport we had a long walk to our terminal to check in - with long queues for security we literally went straight from there to boarding and only just made our flight on time. Although this was cheaper I would not do this again when you are relying on others to be on time.,"June 12, 2016","14    Hotel de Suede St. Germain

They are never too busy to offer assistance. My room was very spacious for Paris with a comfortable bed and an updated bathroom stocked with elegant toiletries which are replenished every day. The location is ideal on a very quiet street but within walking distance of many top tourist attractions. The Rodin Museum is 5 minutes away and Musee D'Orsay 10 minutes. Even the Eiffel Tower and the Pompidou Center are a brisk 30 minute walk away. The breakfast is incredible! Crisp buttery croissants along with a selection of charcuterie and fabulous cheeses they also have scrambled eggs! There are many restaurants and cafes within walking distance.

The front desk people were always giving us help, directions, advice on where to shop, where to eat, and what sites to see first!! My best friend and I had always heard how rude French people were, this was not the case!! The only rude people we met were other tourists!! Every person we stopped on the street gave us help with directions, and our questions!! It was the trip of a lifetime!

782,"I booked this hotel for our family (with 2 kids, age 11 & 8) on booking.com for 3 nights. The first night was charged immediately on the credit card, and I was presented with a copy of the credit card receipt on arrival. The hotel is in a great location. We walked every morning to the Eiffel Tower (approx. 15 mins) and got on to the Big Bus Tour Company tours (2 days, night and cruise package) which was a great value and fantastic way of seeing Paris in a short 3 day visit. The hotel staff are friendly, hotel is spotless (very clean). The only criticism I have is, we were a little cold on our first night, so we asked for an extra blanket for our second night. We were told that, there were no extra blankets with an attitude of ""sorry, we don't have any extra blankets. You are not to first to ask for this"", so if this is something they are aware of, surely they must do something about it. If you book room only, breakfast is 13 Euro per person. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel. A short stroll down the road, there is a nice cafe selling fresh croissants for 1 EUR. Just step out, turn left and right at Rue de Babylone, it is literally 1 min walk to get to this cafe. We are leaving and our check out is 12 pm which is nice. Overall, good stay, good value and a great location. Hope they improve on the extra blanket issue.","July 30, 2015","14    Hotel de Suede St. Germain

The shower unit head was broken so that the water flow was unregulated. The shower controls were dangerous: separate hot and cold taps at child height with very hot water. The room was cleaned everyday and plenty of towels were supplied.Staff were friendly and polite.However, we did not feel that the room that we had rated a three star level.One evening the fire alarm went off. We evacuated down the nearest stairs to the foyer.The staff were unable to find out why the alarm had operated and after half an hour we were allowed to return to our room.

Nothing was ever too much trouble. Prebook a shuttle from the airport or take a taxi to the hotel. Both a reasonably priced. Breaky was delicious (continental basket of french croissants/pastries with juice, tea or coffee around 13euro) you can also purchase a hot breaky (a tiny bit more). It can be brought up to your room or eaten in the courtyard. Safe in room for your passports etc. Powerpoint in main room. No power point in bathroom annoying for us females but there is a supplied hair dryer fitted to the wall. Its a minor con but the shower head needs adjusting or replacing.

802,"This hotel is charming, comfortable and has a warm and welcoming staff. Located in the heart of St Germain des Pres (one block away from noisy Boulevard St Germain), with a fabulous location. One block from Laduree and it's great pastries, 2 blocks from Cafe de Flores and 3 blocks from Cafe Deux Magots. The hotel is decorated in beautiful wallpapers with coordinating draperies, antique furniture and extremely comfortable beds. bedrooms are larger than most parisian miniscule rooms. rooms have small refrigerators (with water) and glasses, safes, and free wifi, plus closets with a full length mirror and double-glazed windows keep even the street side rooms quiet at night. Many packages include a wonderful continental breakfast in the courtyard or the blue & white porcelain breakfast room. Baskets of a variety of mini pastries (croissants, pain au chocolate, hard rolls and more), plus your choice of a hot beverage and orange juice. If you arrive prior to check-in time, they will store your luggage in the closet while you stroll around Paris. Larger rooms with marble shower and bathtub are particularly lovely. Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere, coupled with a warm and friendly staff make this property more desirable than many hotels at a higher price.","March 22, 2018","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

803,"I have stayed in numerous hotels in Paris and this was by far the worst experience. When I arrived, there was no one at the desk. I turned around and noticed a man sitting at the computer opposite from the desk. He eventually greeted me and looked at me wondering. I said I would like to check in at which point he finally got up and went to the desk. In the morning, I went downstairs expecting a nice breakfast. When I arrived, there was practically nothing out. Ten minutes later a woman showed up to serve some other people food. She took about 6-7 minutes to do that and never glanced at either me or the couple who had also entered the dining area. The couple got so upset that they went to speak to the manager. I eventually had the opportunity to order. I asked for scrambled eggs. I was asked three times in the following ten minutes whether there was anything else I wanted: yes, scrambled eggs. In the meantime, in reaction to the other couple's bad experience, the manager came to help out. He asked me twice whether there was anything I wanted: yes, scrambled eggs, please. They didn't have yogurt even though it is on the menu. When checking out, I found out that the eggs were extra, they are not included. The only food that is included is a bunch of pastry items with zero protein (cheese is not available). European hotels tend to have fantastic breakfasts, this was a disappointment both for the service and the food.Based on the photos of other reviewers here, I must have had the smallest room. That's okay, it's Paris, I'm not there to sit in my room. But it was also not as clean as it could have been. I was going to put my jeans somewhere in the bathroom and fortunately checked before doing so: the rod was dusty. Also, the bed is rather uncomfortable, I woke up with considerable pain in the morning.I do agree with the other reviewers on one point though: it is a very good location.With so many hotels in Paris, do yourself a favor and skip this one.","March 21, 2018","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

I'm not sure why they haven't fixed this, as clearly the carpet has been replaced many times. However, that is the only real thing I can say that is somewhat negative. Regardless, I will stay again.Wait. One more thing. I say this all the time when I stay somewhere that uses a blanket! Yuck! No one wants to sit on or inadvertently touch a blanket. Use white duvets!

809,"Don't be deterred by the quirky dips in the floor and the tired carpeting in the hallways. The rooms are large and quiet and our room was ready for our early morning arrival. After many stays in small Parisian hotels we were surprised to find a very large room and an even larger bathroom with walk in shower, separate huge tub and large sink with plenty of storage space. The staff was extremely nice and helpful from the front desk to housekeeping. Probably the best I have met in my many visits to Paris. The included continental breakfast is served in a lovely room with an adjoining patio for outside dining. I read some negative comments about the breakfast before we booked but it is exactly as advertised - Continental. Eggs are available for an additional charge. The young lady serving in the breakfast room is very nice - ask her to warm your milk for morning coffee. Location is great - easy walk to Louvre, Norte Dame and good neighborhood restaurants. If you're not familiar with Paris you may find the elevator to be very small but it's fairly typical in older hotels.","September 5, 2017","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

We had to leave the hotel very early for our flight (3:00 am), our private shuttle was late and we were concerned. The gentleman at the desk began to organize another way to the airport.

813,"We've just returned from 6 nights at this lovely hotel, which is situated in a very pleasant neighborhood that's easily accessible to many Parisian sights, cafes and restaurants. We were able to walk everywhere.I decided to book this hotel when I saw the bargain I'd be getting by making a non-refundable reservation, which included breakfast.....just 160 euros for the top-category room. All hotels give a reduction for non-refundable bookings, but here the reduction was considerably large.Our Prestige room was very spacious, and the bathroom was huge. It was a luxury to have so much space in the room, especially after having been accustomed to Parisian rooms half that size. The large bathroom was a real plus to me. I'm a very early riser, and every morning, I'd have coffee and use my IPad at the bathroom sink counter, and this enabled me to relax and have my own space without disturbing my sleeping husband. The bathroom was not only very spacious, but very modern and had both a VERY large shower and a bathtub. We only used the shower, which was incredible......lots of hot water and great water pressure. The toilet is separate, which, of course, is very convenient. The towel warmer was an added luxury. The only thing it was lacking was a magnifying mirror, though it made no difference to me since I had brought my own.The room itself was a delight....far from modern, but decorated with charming period furniture, which gave it a lot of character. There was lots of space to store our belongings, and we felt comfortable at all times. I requested to view other rooms, and I was kindly shown several rooms that were unoccupied. (I saw all room categories except for standard.) I really liked the fact that each room was unique......different colors, different furniture, different decor....each one had its own charm. Keep in mind that these are not renovated rooms with modern furniture and updated carpeting. This is an old hotel that has maintained its original charm. Like the Prestige rooms, the Superior rooms are quite large, but the bathrooms are average size. Prestige rooms facing the street are larger than those facing the courtyard, but for those of you who like to sleep with the windows open and need absolute silence, I suggest requesting a courtyard room. My personal preference is a room with a street view, even if it means hearing some street traffic in the morning. (When the windows are closed, you don't hear anything.)The breakfast room was a gem, and we truly enjoyed having our first meal in such lovely surroundings. We were entitled to a continental breakfast, which could be supplemented (additional cost) with items such as eggs in any form. The gentleman who served us was very kind and pleasant, and we looked forward to seeing him every morning.At this point, I would like to thank the wonderful staff for the amazing surprise that I received on my birthday.......a beautiful bouquet of about 4 dozen pink roses. The flowers were (and probably still are) absolutely gorgeous !!!","May 11, 2017","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

814,"The hotel is located a couple of streets up from the Boulevard St Germain and close to a few metro stations on the useful lines 4, 10 and 12. So you can easily get to where you want in Central Paris. Line 4 takes you directly from Gare du Nord main railway station (Eurostar) to the St Germain metro which is about a six minute walk away. Our rooms were comfortable and quite large for Paris, although the decor was rather quirky. Beds comfortable. And free wifi. We didn't have the 13 euros continental breakfast in the hotel as the family wanted to experience the cafe culture of Paris. Some of the restaurants nearby are slightly pricey, in terms of both food and drinks. Beers around 10-12 Euros for 500ml. A couple of nights we walked down to the Odeon area where a number of restaurants/bars do happy hours (see my other reviews) with beers and cocktails at 6 Euros. The excellent Musee d'Orsay is about 10 minutes walk. The Eiffel Tour is about 30. Not much contact with the hotel staff as we were out and about most of the time but they were approachable and helpful. As a general point, almost everyone we met in Paris was very friendly, with people stopping us in the street to ask if we needed directions. And we managed to cope with a mixture of English (widely spoken) and schoolboy French.","April 23, 2017","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

815,"If you like the predictability of large hotel chains, Hotel du Danube is not for you. This place is full of quirks but ultimately very charming. This was my second visit and I spent two nights there. The location is amazing and rue de Jacob is particularly nice. The rooms are smallish but tastefully decorated with some period furniture. The breakfast is excellent (but you have to walk through a courtyard to get there and you have to pay 1.80 euros extra if you want an egg). The staff is friendly. An added bonus is that you can use the hotel wifi from the equally quirky and charming bistrot next door.","April 6, 2017","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

816,"I chose the Danube based on Trip Advisor reviews which talked about generous room size ( for Paris). I booked on their website because that was advised, and I got what they advertised as a discounted March rate including free breakfast. When I received confirmation, the room size was quoted as being 12m square. Alarmed, I wrote an email immediately requesting an upgrade to a larger room. Response was vague indicating hotel was full. When we checked in, we were shown to a 5th floor garret room off the elevator. It was straight out of the 1950's! Decent sized bathroom, but very tired. During the 4 nights we were there, our key didn't work at least 10 times. Staff mostly accommodating with one exception ( man who initially checked us in). Hotel staff admitted on check out day that we had received one of poorest rooms in hotel, and that had we asked, for a little more money we could have had a nicer room. He said posted room rates were never charged as such. I felt very duped, and said so. There are nice aspects to the hotel, but it has plenty of competition and in no way deserves the gushing accolades of so many of the reviews it receives.","March 31, 2017","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

817,"I have just returned from spending a week at the Hotel du Danube with a childhood friend who had always wanted to visit Paris. I had stayed here before, but some years had passed since the last time. The hotel has the perfect location, being located just off Blvd. St. Germain, directly across the river from the Louvre, and between the Musee d'Orsay and Notre Dame. The rooms are some of the largest that I have experienced among the variety of three-star hotels that I have stayed in. The room rates are normally at the high end of what I am comfortable paying. Going in the off season, and being willing to pre-pay, I was able to get an attractive discount. I always choose a superior street-side room. The rooms are well soundproofed, beautifully decorated, and extremely comfortable. There is a large well-lit closet, an in-room safe, facilities to make coffee and tea, and a mini-fridge. The toiletries are replenished daily. The continental breakfast can be served in the breakfast room, or brought to your room. The quality of the breakfast items is first-rate. The front desk staff is well-informed, friendly and polite. They helped me locate a pharmacy when my friend became ill. They arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport, which we took care of the night before we left. We paid our bill then, so early the next morning we could just get up and go. The neighborhood is a lively one, with restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, and shopping close at hand. I honestly cannot thing of a single negative. I can recommend this hotel without hesitation. I hope to return sometime soon. Merci beaucoup et a la prochaine fois!","March 21, 2017","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

The hotel was selected with the following criteria : no more than 150 euros /day including breakfast, ""strategic"" location (my wife is a Shopper with capital S...) near boutiques, but close enough to the Louvre and to Musee d'Orsay which is my absolute favorite.So this small elegant and cozy hotel that I picked, was what I really needed: no big morning buffet but an absolute basic continental breakfast served by a really nice gentleman, no luxury lounge but exactly the size to wait for a taxi or read a newspaper, quiet rooms not big but with enough space to walk around, with a super comfortable bed, nice and clean bathroom and just a short walk away from food and drinks as well as super chic boutiques for people with medium plus incomes.

A short walk gets you to the hustle and bustle, the Metro subway trains, the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, Notre Dame, the Latin Quarter, Luxembourg Gardens, and more. Small grocery stores are nearby for an evening bottle of wine with cheese in the room or patio area. The staff (Romain & Jerome especially but also Michel, Gregory, Thomas and the breakfast staff too) goes out of their way to be accommodating, but unobtrusive. They helped us re-do plans, map out locations, get quick affordable transportation, communicate a correction on a follow up trip to Bayeux - above and beyond. The breakfast service was great with this boutique hotel's charming, relaxed feel. Note it is an old building remodeled with some uneven floors and circular stairs, but beautifully decorated, and amazingly quiet even facing the street as the double sets of windows surprisingly blocked noise better than most newer hotels.

829,"The best boutique hotel in Paris!!! We just spent 9 days in Paris and loved it.1.Location in Rue Jacob in Saint Germain des Pres....truly Parisian ambiance, perfect location for art & antiques lovers!!! Close to everything. Metro is close by and taxis are available just in the corner. Walking is easy all around St Germain and 6th arrondisement. We even went to the 7th and Orsay, L'Orangerie and the Louvre . Also great walk to Notre Dame.2. Great rooms well designed, renovated and decorated but with a real French flavor.The hotel has WiFi and Flat screen TV in rooms but has kept a real old world classy ambiance3. Prestige rooms have the best renovated bathrooms !!! Large with tubs, enclosed shower with invisible glass doors, large sink, warming towel rack, separate WC . All separated from your room by doors...one from room to bathroom area ; another for WC; another from WC to rest of bathroom. Important if someone is sleeping and the other person is in bathroom.4.Front desk staff is the best!!! Jerome, Jeremy and Romain are friendly, helpful with a great attitude and have great suggestion.Speak English well. They call for reservations if needed in restaurants and can find out if certain museums are open or whatever you need. 5. TV has CNN, BBC, and other European channels on top of their regular French channels. In Spanish I suggested they offer TVE 1 rather than TVE 24 Hrs....that offers only news and no programming.... BORING!!!!..TVE 1 has both news and programming. We have watched it all over Europe so we know its available. 6. Breakfast is in lovely room by the central patio. Well served and ample offerings at 13 Eur. Well priced for Paris. The bistro next door charges 10 Eur for a Crème or Café au Lait with a piece of bread(baguette) and butter.7. Great area for restaurants, bistros and Brasseries. The Epicerie around the corner in Rue St Peres if fabulous!!! Great to buy water BUT there is so much more....fruits, already made food & from baguettes to sweets. Great for informal lunch at the courtyard of the hotel.All around a GREAT experience!!","June 18, 2016","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

833,"I have stayed in several hotels in Saint Germain de Pres and currently The Danube is my preferred hotel. After two stays in two different rooms both facing the street, I see no reason to stay elsewhere. It is posted as a 3 Star but France or Paris have a different classification or standard than The States, a Best Western in Dayton Ohio would be a 3 Star - in France that Best Western would be a Two Star - I have decided to find the best 3 Star hotels in Paris and stay in their best rooms - it will always be cheaper than that extra star and you would hardly be in shabby surroundings. Hotel Danube situated between The Seine and Boulevard St Germain in one of the most charming quarters in Paris, easy to walk to musee' D'Orsay, Lourve, Rodin. Notre Dame a ten minute walk, centrally located, Hotel Danube , lovely boutique hotel.I recommend and I have stayed in hundreds getting close to thousands of hotels and this one was a fine choice for me.

834,"A good little hotel in the centre of Paris. Best bit of advice is to go elsewhere for breakfast if it is not included in your rate as room is small and choice does not relfect the delicacies of Paris at the finest of what it can offer for the cost, but this choice is enitrely up to you where you go. Ask to see the rooms first as they vary in some way and you may find one to your liking but all are generally clean and well presented. There is a certain charm to this place however and certainly you will hopefully get a good nights sleep in preparation for the next day. The staff are polite and there is lots of charm in the area to explore if you like art.","April 10, 2016","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

837,"This ideally located hotel boasts a fine set of rooms around a small garden courtyard. Our standard room featured a variety of handsome antique furnishings in an old school setting, with a modern updated bathroom. We appreciated the separate wash closet and the small refrigerator and open shelving in the ample clothes closet. Breakfast was very pleasant in a small room off the interior yard, though it proved too full to visit at certain times of morning. In warmer seasons more space may be made available. On both days of my stay I asked for use of an iron to press a shirt I needed to wear for work. Brief efforts on Day 1 yielded a friendly shrug (no iron could be found) but a promise to call up when the house iron could be located. Day 2 yielded the same response, something of a surprise when they understood that I had asked the day previously and truly needed it. I covered up with a sweater. No harm done, but I would have appreciated more generous effort with a hotel of this kind.","January 31, 2016","15    Hotel du Danube Saint Germain

840,"Assia and Nathalie welcome you warmly into their spacious, beautiful and wonderfully clean apartment. Breakfast focuses on conversation as well as tasty food (freshly squeezed orange juice, freshly made chocolate croissants, expresso or cappuccino, fruit with cheese). Dining becomes a social experience, a French custom (but not so common in our native New York), where questions are answered and opinions are shared. It is as though you immediately become a member of a family that is supportive and kind. For example, Paris became very hot the week we stayed (up to 100F) so Assia decided to buy each room a (very expensive) Dyson air cooler so that we would be more comfortable (most B+Bs do not currently have air conditioners, and AC is prohibited in this apartment building since it is a registered historic site). This is a truly ""premium"" housing experience for tourists and I believe that it is worth any extra money that it may cost.

The apartment is beautiful, with everything you could possibly want or need provided. It is very secure and is situated in a very safe part of the city. Although several metro and bus stops are within easy walking distance, the city centre is less than half an hour’s stroll from the apartment so I tended to walk everywhere.

Assia and Nathalie will also share their recommendations along with maps and guidebooks. The location is quiet and secure with only a 15 minute walk to the centre. There are however loads of places to visit and eat at right on the door step. The Metro is a 5 minute walk away. I can’t rate this B&B highly enough.

The room was cleaned daily and a bottle of mineral water provided, and there was also a mini fridge. Breakfast was served in the dining room next door and included your choice of croissants, fruit, bread and cheese, ham, yogurt, etc. as well as fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee or tea, whatever you like.

They really went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable and had everything I needed not only in the apartment but for my days in Paris in general. The ONLY downside is that you are in someone's home in a condo building so you do hear others talking, walking, etc. but I am SUPER SENSITIVE to noise and energy of others.

Not only did Assia make sure our stomachs were full but we had great conversations and got ideas of things to see and do. They were always willing to go the extra bit and help guests get to the metro and buy tickets or provide maps and detailed metro directions to ensure their guests were never lost and returned home safe. The B&B was in a great location and access to the metro was only a few blocks away and there were some great restaurants in the area (take Assia & Nathalie's suggestions you cannot go wrong).

They pulled out the maps and began plotting our transit plan. They both knew in order for us to make the appointment they would have to walk us to the appropriate train station. Assia wrote down the street names to look for and handed us metro tickets and sent us on our way. We arrived perfectly and with 6 min to spare. We never would have made it if it wasn’t for them. The next morning we met the other couple staying at the b & b. They arrived the night before and we all had a lovely breakfast together that Assia prepared. Everyday Assia would assist us with travel plans, directions, and recommendations. She supplied us with maps, umbrellas and even did a load of laundry for us since we were on an extended trip.

868,"I stayed a few nights in Paris in the lead up to a conference I was attending in another part of France (Lyon) in March. I have previously stayed in the Marais district, and love it for it's lively but village atmosphere, proximity to galleries and museums, local and authentic cafes and restaurants, and great shopping. Traveling as a single female, I wished to stay in a familiar area, but still have a unique experience.My stay with Assia and Nathalie exceeded my expectations. The Notre Dame room I stayed in was incredible - much brighter, more spacious and finer finishes than hotel rooms I was considering, an extremely comfortable bed, and glorious outlook onto a secluded courtyard. The bathroom was sparkling clean and plenty of room. The shower over the jacuzzi works well (great water pressure and temperature) - and although I didn't think I would use it, I must admit that soaking in the jacuzzi was a luxurious and relaxing treat!Assia and Nathalie were lovely guests. The layout of the apartment is such that you can come and go as you please, but still have the advantage of their local knowledge and interesting, flowing conversation when or if you'd like it. Walking off the street and through the beautiful old building to their renovated apartment, one really feels like a Parisian! Recommendations for restaurants were spot on, and Assia kindly made some phone calls for me as my French is terrible!There was a wide variety of breakfast to chose from each morning - everything was fresh and delicious (e.g., yummy organic yogurt, freshly squeezed juice, warm crossaints), and certainly the best coffee I found in France! It also provided an opportunity to chat with the other guests, Assia and Nathalie, which added a personal, homely and warm touch to my stay, without being intrusive.Assia and Nathalie have found the right balance between super comfortable accommodation and professionalism, and sincere hospitality. All in the perfect little pocket of Paris. I wish I was back there already!","March 22, 2018","16    Assia & Nathalie

870,"How wonderful to find lodging that feels both private, and also welcoming and engaged. Assia and Nathalie's hospitality was top notch - every detail was considered, even adjusting the breakfast to accommodate vegans. The bedroom was spacious and comfortable. We stayed in the room with the whirlpool tub - which was perfect after more than 10 miles of walking in one day. The location was perfect. Non-touristy restaurants and shops nearby; walked to all the sights. We were even able to come back mid-day to take breaks before heading back out on our sightseeing. Please note that the whirlpool room does not have a separate shower - so you need to take a bath with a hand shower each night (a bit tricky and you can get a little cold). However, we didn't mind because the whirlpool was totally worth it. Just a heads up, they have another room with a shower only - if that's something you'll need. The rooms are part of an apartment suite that is located in a historic building with an amazing gate and an original fresco on the ceiling in the foyer. Gorgeous!In sum, Assia and Nathalie made us feel like we were old friends, helped us orient like a local, and made us excited to return to stay with them next time we're in Paris.

When we arrived jet-lagged and exhausted, our kind hostesses let us sleep away the morning, gently introducing us to our first day in Paris with cappachino, an amazing breakfast spread and lively conversation. Each morning our hostesses went over our itinerary in detail with us, with instructions to call them if there was ever a problem. We felt that we were staying with dear relatives.

The room itself is beautiful and spacious and located in a lovely and quiet building in the Marais district and thus very central to many of Paris sights.

With all that already being perfect the hosts Assia and Nathalie are really what made our stay an unforgettable experience and something that stands out from every other trip we've made so far. Both are very friendly and knowledgeable of the area and helped with suggestions for sights, restaurants and public transport to plan our visit to the wonderful city.

Breakfast was delicious with an extensive choice, beautifully presented and a great opportunity to get to know our hosts and their other guests. As a general rule, we tend to keep to ourselves however Assia and Nathalie immediately put us at ease with their easy charm and engaging conversation.This was made all the more enjoyable discussing the previous day's events with our fellow Australian guests.

Both are wonderful, friendly, engaging and eager to help.Staying at the Parc Royal Marais is like staying with old friends - as long as your friends have impeccable taste, allows you to stay in their best room, provides you with delicious food in the morning (we're still dreaming about those croissants), and provides you with all the right suggestions about where to go and what to do...on second thought, I'm not sure if I have any friends like that (I can only wish).The Notre Dame room that we stayed in was lovely and the bed was very comfortable - all the amenities were appreciated and the decor was extremely tasteful.From a pure nit-picking perspective - air conditioning is not a standard feature in Paris so we left the windows open and the Parisian mosquitoes feasted on me.

887,"We had the pleasure of staying with Assia and Nathalie in the Place de Vosges room for our three nights in Paris and could not have been happier with our decision! If you are not satisfied with some of the hotel options available in the Marais (as we were when we were looking for accommodations), Parc Royal Marais is the perfect solution. You have all the benefits of an apartment (larger, better value) with all the benefits of a hotel (a concierge, breakfasts, room cleaning, etc) and for us, it was the best decision. The Marais is a fabulous neighborhood and between our feet and the subway, we were able to get all over the city quite easily.The room was exactly as pictured, which in our experience is rare, and we were very happy and comfortable. We were welcomed upon our arrival by Assia who explained various aspects of the room, the neighborhood and helped us narrow down a few options for lunch. If you prefer a shower over tub, the Place de Vosges room has a beautiful bathroom with a large rain shower head. High end bath gel, lotion and shampoo is provided together with luxurious towels (nothing worse than rough, thin towels - not the case here!) In the room, there is a little area with tea and bottled water (which was replenished daily, although the Paris tap water is very good quality), an empty mini fridge to keep leftovers or snacks and two closets. Assia and Nathalie anticipate your needs and are extremely lovely hosts. One day we returned with a bottle of beautiful French wine we purchased on a tour and the next day a bottle opener was left to open it without us even having to ask! Each morning we enjoyed breakfast and lovely conversation. Assia is fluent in English and Nathalie is much better with understanding and speaking in English than she gives herself credit for ;-)Some notes: (1) if you book directly you receive a lower price than available through third party websites (highly recommended to book directly); (2) the breakfasts are OUTSTANDING and something we looked forward to each day. You are offered many choices and we picked baguette, French cheeses, pane au chocolat and a gorgeous fruit plate and the quality was as fantastic as it was delicious. In fact the espresso and cappuccino, bread and cheese was some of the best we tasted in Paris; (3) if you are a light sleeper you will be very happy with the quiet rooms. While Paris is a big, loud, beautiful city - the location of Parc Royal Marais is such that you would not even know because it is very peaceful and serene.Overall, this is a wonderful property with wonderful owners and I encourage anyone looking for an alternative to a traditional hotel to seek out this fabulous little spot!","March 16, 2017","16    Assia & Nathalie

We stayed in 8 bed and breakfasts in France, and the Parc Royal Marais was our favorite. The owners (Assia and Nathalie) are charming and helpful. They recommended sites to visit, showed us which buses or metros to use, prepared delicious breakfasts and even gave us a personalized tour of the Latin Quarter, where they had lived before moving to the Marais. As a retired attorney who loves culture and music, I was delighted to be in the company of a former UNESCO attorney and a classical violinist. Assia and Nathalie speak English well, and that added so much to our knowledge and our experience in Paris. We were able to discuss world events and gain insight into how the French view the world. Our room was beautiful, comfortable and overlooked a garden. It was quiet, and designed with care. Everything was new, relaxing and state of the art. Breakfast is at the time of your choosing, and Assia goes to her favorite bakery each morning to bring you delicious croissants and petite pains au chocolate. (I remember them longingly now!).

Very helpful front desk guy guide me through the hotel and provide in-depth introduction to Paris. The room is also a big plus, nearly everything can be controlled by the iPad. Amenities provide by the hotel also at a very high grade. It’s sad that I only would be staying at Paris for a short time.

898,"This hotel is among the best Curio by Hilton out there - and as a loyal member at Hilton I have tried a few. We visited last august. Warm welcome where staff was amazing and helped us getting our luggage and tired kids out of the car. Beautiful room with nice bathroom. Maybe not the biggest rooms but more than adequate and very, very comfortable. Breakfast is delicious. The selection is not as you know it from big hotels with mass produce, but what they offer is of the highest quality and more than enough. The bar is über cool again with great staff. We decided to not eat at the restaurant this time since we wanted something a bit more laid back with two small kids. But my wife and I will be back for a weekend late March and are really looking forward to eating at the restaurant this time. And once again enjoy the warm hospitality of the hotel. Great work to all at the Niepce Paris.","February 26, 2019","17    Niepce Paris Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton

899,"Whilst a little out of the centre of the city, this hotel is a perfect little oasis. The overall quality is fantastic, complimented nicely by incredibly friendly and helpful staff. The breakfast selection is a little limited but what’s there is all good but the real winner is the restaurant in the evening. The food we had was utterly delicious, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. Supplemented by a delicious wine from a cleverly put together (if slightly limited) wine list and quirky, happy waiting staff. I can not recommend it highly enough. If you’re tall, like me, prepare to be unable to stand beneath the shower, but the head is not fixed so it’s a tiny issue. And apparently the bedroom lighting is a little too ‘romantic’ for the application of delicate makeup (a mirror light is required apparently) but these are seriously the only ‘faults’ I could pick out. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend and/or revisit. ","February 12, 2019","17    Niepce Paris Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton

900,"Unassuming entrance in a quiet neighborhood leads to a very well appointed, very clean, very comfortable, very well run boutique hotel. General Manager Rozlaine H. has assembled an amazing staff. EVERYONE who works there is extremely hospitable and helpful. Special thanks to Maeva, Samira, Diane, and Pedro at the front desk for facilitating our array of sightseeing side trips and transportation. Likewise, much gratitude to those serving and preparing our delicious food and beverages, and to those who kept our room and common areas immaculate. Although the 52 room hotel was booked full, we rarely encountered other guest outside the bar and restaurant. It was as if we had this beautiful Paris home to ourselves for our eight day stay.As stated in other reviews, the neighborhood boasts many bakeries, bistros, grocery stores/pharmacies, the Pernety Metro Station, and a not to be missed Trip Advisor Certificate of Excellence winning restaurant - La Cantine Du Troquet.On our first day we walked from the hotel to the nearby Montparnasse Tower which offers stunning panoramic 56th floor views of Paris, its monuments and districts. It gave us a good idea of the ""lay of the land"" and reinforced our good decision of choosing the Hotel Niepce as our home base.A highly recommended property. We will definitely stay here again.","January 27, 2019","17    Niepce Paris Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton

The rooms are very nicely decorated in modern decor with a safe, small refrigerator, large flat panel television, robes, slippers and a tablet to use in the room. The bathrooms are clean and the showers are efficient though there is not a bathtub. The staff is very friendly and professional adding to the elegant feel of the hotel. They check you in and out very quickly and are very knowledgeable. The breakfast buffet is small but the food is high quality. The eggs are fresh as is the various breads.The highlight to the hotel is the location. Tucked away in a quiet area but close enough to many services. Right outside the doors, across the street is a large and convenient supermarket. A few feet more and your on a quaint little street with shops and restaurants. The subway station is also a 2 minute walk and will whisk you away to any part of the city. Overall, a wonderful, clean hotel in a quiet little area that has easy access to services.

No matter how I adjusted the thermostat (could be done via the box on the wall or the iPad on the nightstand), the temperature in the room would not change—and it was VERY WARM.

It is in a very nice neighborhood south of the Seine close to Montparnasse rail station, we did walk to the Eiffel tower from there but it was a hike. One evening we just walked around the neighborhood and enjoyed a much more real feeling of what Paris is vs. the areas North of the Seine closer to the Champs-Elysees. Lastly...while i am used to European hotels having small rooms this could have been the smallest room i have ever been in.

924,"This hotel opened three months ago - and really still smells new. That was exciting. I usually don't stay in Montparnasse - but since I had to leave towards the south the next day, I chose this hotel (and becauce I collect HiltonHonors points). I got a parking space right in front of the hotel - thanks to the summer holidays and a national holiday. Everyone left Paris - except for the tourists. You have to climb down some stairs to get to the front desk - which is the only not comfortable thing at that place. A nice smelling elevator gets you to the room - I was helped with my luggage - very friendly. The room was ok big - no real space for my suitcase - but enough room to unpack, if you needed to. Nice features like lightswitches for every light directly next to your bed, crisp linen, cosy bed, big bathroom - cool design and international TV channels. I came back from a stroll through Montparnasse (I have been to Paris a lot - but forgot how nice this Quartier is) - and had a good night sleep.

Once you buy your metro ticket at Pernety then you can enjoy Paris and it was lovely to retreat to the hotel in the evenings as it's in a quiet residential area.

935,"nice hotel in a great neighborhood within a 15 min walk from Montparnasse and 10 min bus from the bus shuttle to CDG. Staff was friendly, bilingual and the front desk agent actually escorted me to my room. Something that I have not experience at any other hotel. Room was small, average by European standards, but perfectly adequate and bathroom was larger than most French bathrooms. And they had A/C which was clutch in the current heatwave. Around the corner from a Metro station. Would stay here again!","July 28, 2018","17    Niepce Paris Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton

936,"This was my first trip to Paris, my husband's tenth. He usually stays at the Hilton property closer to center of town but with this new hotel we decided to book at Niepce. When we arrived we were greeted with a friendly staff who gave us recommendations on things to do and dining options nearby. The restaurant is pretty pricey but we found lots of good food nearby. The rooms were modern and while a little small, gave a great boutique hotel atmosphere you don't typically receive at Hilton properties. I love boutique hotels but also love the Hilton experience. The front desk staff was great in assisting us with printing out our tickets as well as helping us make reservations and plan our day. Subway is very easy to use and the Pernaty station is right around the corner. Would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Paris.","July 23, 2018","17    Niepce Paris Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton

Breakfast is fresh in the restaurant, which seems to have been a patio which is now covered. You have to go down the stairs to get to reception, which is not always easy when you have a heavy suitcase. Kind service, even received a welcome glass of champagne.

947,"I rarely give a bad review but this hotel did not live up to expectations. Yes the rooms were small and a bit out of date, but considering that price that was to be expected. What I didn't expect is that the room was not clean. It was not clean on arrival and was not cleaned properly during our stay. Nail clippings on the bathroom floor, and hair on the shower floor (which remain there after the room was ""cleaned"" the following day since we didn't use the shower the first night.) There was mold under the silicon grout and not just a little either. The carpet was dirty although to be fair it could have been just old stains that are now permanent. We choose not to look to closely at the room condition since we would be there only two nights and we are not very picky about that sort of thing. The thing that bothered me the most though was that there was a nail that stuck out of the carpeted floor a good solid quarter of an inch above the carpet, right in the doorway to the bathroom. As my wife is diabetic we are very careful about foot injuries. I had to lay the shower rug folded double over it so she didn't step on it in the night. I mention this for a few reasons. First of all I find it difficult to believe that the cleaning help had never noticed it (since it clearly didn't pop up there overnight). Secondly I also found it difficult to believe that no one reported it before we got that room. Lastly when I told the gentleman at the front desk I was left with the impression that it would be immediately forgotten once we left. I say that because when I described the issue to him he didn't seem terribly interested, and after I described precisely where it was just out side the bathroom door he then asked me if it was in the room? ....it was as if he wasn't listening to me at all. He finished up by telling me someone would look at it ""tomorrow"" but he never wrote anything down nor logged it on to a computer. I suspect, possibly unfairly, that it is still there. My final disappointment was that our bags where stored in a hallway after we checked out of our room but before we finally left Paris at the end of the day. Most hotels would have put them in a secure area.","July 6, 2019","18    Perreyve Hotel

949,"I have been staying at the Perreyve Hotel for more than twenty years whenever I visit Paris, but recently there have been some changes which make it more difficult to enjoy the visit. A mechanism for closing the doors of the rooms has been installed and it is no longer possible to close the doors quietly, like a civilized person; the doors don’t close unless you slam them violently. The consequence is that during a great part of the night you cannot sleep because of the neighbours coming home and slamming their doors. Also, one of the gentlemen at the reception now has the habit of talking by phone during a great part of the night; his voice is loud and it is impossible to sleep until he decides to go to rest. Also, the windows have been sealed; it is impossible to open them if you want to let some fresh air come in. All the rest, like the location near the Luxembourg Garden, a friendly and efficient staff, a good breakfast etc., are just fine. What a pity!","January 13, 2019","18    Perreyve Hotel

955,"I first stayed at this hotel when I was a Graduate Student at the Sorbonne (1973-74)and was working at an office on rue Soufflot. It was a very convenient walk from the hotel across the Luxembourg Gardens to the office near the Pantheon. Over the years, whenever I returned to Paris as a teacher and then tourist, I chose to stay at Hotel Perreyve. They greatly remodeled the bathrooms in order to provide the basic amenities that an American would require, shower, sink, toilet. I was very impressed during my most recent stay, June 2018, at these upgrades. The rooms are simple, not the Sheraton or the Hilton, but they are clean and provide a TV, phone, desk and comfortable beds. The breakfast bar provides an excellent choice of items including cereals, yogurt, breads, cheese, fruit juice with a choice of tea, coffee and hot chocolate. The price for the room plus breakfast is extremely reasonable considering Paris and the location, near the Luxembourg Gardens and the Latin Quarter cannot be beat. I can recommend this hotel without reservation--although you need to make your reservation in advance because this quiet little hotel is getting to be known more now. Bon sejour!

958,"The hotel is nicely located a block away from Luxembourg Gardens and well situated for a number of bus and metro options. While I normally book a single room, I had booked a good price for a double in this case, with breakfast included. I only ended up using the breakfast on two of my four days, but it was nice to start the day with a pot of coffee and steamed milk and a few pastries without having to go searching for a cafe and patisserie first thing.My initial room was a rather large double, but I unfortunately found it felt a bit dark and airless for me - as the locked window overlooked an interior wall/small air shaft. Madame at the front desk was wonderfully helpful and patient with my request about whether a change would be possible, and the next day found me moved up to the 4th floor in a technically smaller twin - but with a street view, and an airy light blue wall color - which I enjoyed for the rest of my stay.After being in a London townhouse hotel without a lift earlier in my trip, it was nice that the Perreyve had a small but swift elevator when I was hauling my luggage, or just felt too tired to take the stairs at the end of a day of touring the city.","April 18, 2018","18    Perreyve Hotel

971,"This is an excellent choice largely because of the location. It’s nearly at the gates of the Luxembourg Gardens, and yet the neighborhood is extremely quiet. Other advantages include a number of metro lines close to the hotel, and proximity to the upscale clothing shopping area northeast of Bonne Marché, around Rue du Four and Rue du Dragon. On Sunday mornings, it’s a 5 minute walk to the Marché Bio—in our humble opinion, the very best street food market in Paris. A feast for the eyes and stomach!Otherwise, the hotel is rather minimalist. Rooms are fine, but small; service impersonal. The breakfast is not worth the price, esp. with so many great cafés nearby. Bread and Roses, kitty-corner to the hotel, is really fantastic. Our bed was great, though, and the room was very quiet, so we have no complaints.

No matter how much I tried to tell her that's what we were quoted and showed our booking confirmation she would not budge. I sent an email to Accor to complain and got an email back to say they would be in touch within 48hrs still waiting........ Apart from this this is nothing close to the hotel except the gardens and not much variety for eating. Would definitely recommend somewhere else.,"June 24, 2016","18    Perreyve Hotel

The rooms are clean, comfortable, and quiet, and the surrounding neighborhood feels safe in the evening. The staff is friendly and can communicate well in English.

Gare du Nord is the alternative station to change to the Metro. There are some stairs involved in both options, I believe. There is a small walk from the Metro to the hotel and it is probably best to work out your left and right turns ahead of time.Staff were always friendly, polite and spoke good English. There was a lift. The entry and breakfast area was pleasant but we did not breakfast in when there were so many interesting options within a short walk. The hotel is in a pleasant and quiet back street just a short walk from Rue de Rennes in the 6th, which is a charming part of Paris to stay. There are many pleasant places to eat and drink nearby.Our room was clean and pleasant but very small. I have been told that this is what one must expect in Paris but it was very small. Having said that, because of the oddly shaped room there was space for our bags and storage space with a safe. There was a little table and chair. The lighting in the bedroom was poor, but good in the bathroom. There was no coffee making or fridge. The bathroom was modern, clean and tiny. There was free WiFi.There are no cheap options in Paris.","May 4, 2016","18    Perreyve Hotel

983,"We enjoyed our 5 night stay at Hotel Perreyve. Our room was on the 1st floor, I requested a corner room on booking but didn't get it. One thing to know - this is a small, quaint hotel. Do not expect space or modern facilities. The room was tiny and I bruised my elbows every time I used the shower ;) But thats all part of the charm! We thought it was lovely. The bed was very comfortable, we had great sleeps. Virtually no noise from the street, a very quiet neighbourhood (we stayed from a Sunday to a Friday) . Only noise was from within the hotel, we could hear all the noise/conversations from reception so would book a room on a higher level next time. I wore earplugs so it wasn't too bad. Only other negatives was our room was right above the entrance which glowed lights all night but the curtains did a good job at blocking out most of the light. The service was polite and helpful, the owner called and booked us lunch at a nearby restaurant as our french wasn't good enough. By far, the highlight was the location. There are plenty of cafes and patisseries nearby for breakfast lunch and dinner plus several food markets. The Luxembourg Gardens are virtually on your doorstep - a beautiful oasis, perfect for people watching! We walked everywhere, 15mins to the metro, 10-15mins to Notre Dame.

Still in Paris but it took a metro ride to get to the main attractions, say a ten min walk to the metro & depending where you were going a ten or fifteen minute trip including changing lines if need be. It was very clean, the rooms were dated but in great condition, the staff were excellent, it had all the facilities: wifi, bathroom, A/C which in a Paris summer is a must, and there was a lift which is very handy with luggage. The bed was very comfortable and it had BBC & CNN channels for the news. Reception staff were great and answered all questions and gave directions. They also recommended local eateries. I went to Georgette which was medium to high priced, but fantastic food! It could be quite expensive if you have a three course meal but one course and tap water was perfect for me. It was Bastille day weekend and lots of places close on a Monday but when leaving I saw a couple of cute bakeries. A quiet area with limited eateries but all quality. It had a cute breakfast area down stairs and a small sitting area with magazines, cozy and tastefully done.

Fabulous reception staff who welcomed us by name as they were expecting us! 2 rooms were adjacent and although separate were on a secluded corridor with one door so when locked opened up our stay into a fantastic suite. Only 4 rooms per floor (6) so each floor had similar suites throughout. The beds were fabulous, clean linen and soft pillows and quilts. Air con, water, fridge, Nespresso machine, hairdrier (excellent), toiletries, bath in one room and shower in other. Large plasma tv in each room, free WiFi and proper single bed added for extra child. Fresh towels, water and housekeeping each day. Trouser press and iron and irojing board. Breakfast fresh and substantial. 10 min walk to tour eiffel line and course de vincennes metro at top of street (1min). Lots of restaurants, supermarkets, take aways within a few minutes. Staff very friendly with great English. Bar on site. Unfortunately we couldn't stay longer. Jam packed schedule for us from.morning until nite. Kids wanting to go home at every opportunity ie hotel comete as they loved it. All in all fabulous and I would hope to return and I am not easily pleased lol!!!","April 25, 2019","19    Hotel Comete Paris

1006,My partner and I stayed at Hotel Comete for a weekend break in October. Our room was a reasonable size for a weekend break and the finish was stylish and practical. At breakfast there was a lot of choice and despite being late comers the food buffet had been replenished and was fresh. The staff were very welcoming and informative. The area surrounding the hotel has a secondary school and feels safer to walk around. Would definitely return to stay at Hotel Comete. ,"January 1, 2019","19    Hotel Comete Paris

Also, there is a nearby term that can take you to other areas of town.

1013,"We have been to Paris several times, at different hotels over the years. While we did not encounter any rudeness in our previous visit, we can’t remember a more obliging staff than those I encountered at Hotel Comete. We arrived few hours prior to check-in time and when we explained to Tamar that we needed to attend a family function, she was able to request a speedy room clean up. We were able to access to our room two hours prior to the standard check-in time. Later, Angelique took time out to explain the touristy spots that were easy access from the hotel on the metro line 1 (the metro line closest to the hotel). Beside the fabulously friendly staff, not just Tamar and Angelique, but everyone else we dealt with, the hotel has a boulangerie/patisserie a stone throw away (around 300 m away). We spend many happy mornings exploring its croissants and patisseries offerings. The super market Franprix is also conveniently close to create a pick-nick basket of your liking without breaking the bank. We also like our room, which is of decent size for two persons. Actually, we just came back from Kyoto so the room was quite large compared to what we were used to in Japan. The only minus, and this is very personal, was the daily free water bottles we received from the hotel. We would have preferred that the hotel provides a refill fountain for our water bottles and thus, decreases the amount of throw away plastic. Overall, we love this hotel.","July 3, 2018","19    Hotel Comete Paris

Having stayed in many hotels over the years, I can say that this is one of my two favourites (it's a close call as to which is best) and easily the best value hotel in a major city. Why? Firstly, the staff go out of their way to make sure everything about your stay is perfect. Secondly, the rooms which, while compact, are tastefully furnished, spotlessly clean and equipped with everything you might need, including a safe. Third, the modern bathrooms with rain shower. Fourth, added bonuses such as the espresso machines in every room, free bottles of water, and fresh macaroons on the first night. Fifth, the excellent breakfast with fresh croissants, breads, beautiful scrambled eggs, cheeses, fruit, apple tart, yoghurts, and more. Sixth, the location, in a nice area, just a minute from the metro line 1 and tram lines 3. And finally, the room rates which represent amazing value for money. Superb!

I'd have really preferred a simple kettle. The macaroons on the bed was a nice touch though....Breakfast was delicious. And the coffee there was greatThe only problem I had was the neighbourhood. I had chosen this place because it was right in the middle of my trajectory in terms of where I was coming from and where I wanted to go, however I didn't realise that it was close to a public square where they chose to have a demonstration. The metro to the stations were disrupted and I took a taxi to be on the safer side. A little warning would've been nice...

With no lift and a very heavy luggage, it was a real nightmare (even though I must say, the porter was so kind to help me for at least halfway. I still want to thank him).So my suggestion is that you check at which floor you are. Also stairway is so steep that it is also kind of dangerous if you have heavy luggage with you. Secondly, my room was extremely cold because the heating was off and not working. So I asked the porter again to help me on that. He did it, but it took a good 3 hours to get a decent temperature in the room. Quite bad then. In general though, rooms are nice and cozy; shared bathroom more than OK.

The main door is digital key controlled with security cameras all over.I would have given it a five however no air conditioning as with most euro hotels. No lift. The receptionist would be and is kind to heft the suitcases up to the room. Better travel light just in case. Single French TV channel which of course was French to us.There was a radiator in the bathroom which could be used as room heater or to dry clothes. Which we did. Not to leave the windows open in the night as insects might get attracted to the room light. In such an event simply ask the receptionist to help out.No restaurant in the hotel. Keeping in mind the number of food joints around its not an issue.Definitely coming back here for the excellent location, good rooms and excellent service.

1048,"Seriously? To get to the room on the fifth floor I had to climb very narrow and steep stairs. Great exercise, but not what I was looking for at 10 pm with suitcases on my hands. Only to find a tiny room with a shared bathroom with all the rooms on the fifth floor. I don't believe that people are still considering this property as an option for 90 euro per night.The ""lively"" neighborhood means there are cars horning all through the night and ""many restaurants"" means greasy kebab and other joints that lack hygiene.Lesson learned: you might have to spend more than a hundred euros per night for a decent stay in Paris. If necessary.If not, better avoid this overrated destination, and travel and enjoy places where you get more for the money. ","June 30, 2018","20    Hotel de L'Union

The staff were really friendly with us and could speak English. - The room was small but it wasn't a problem for us. The beds were very comfortable.

There are also a lot of markets, bistrôts and other stores in the neighborhood. The only downside is that there isn't an elevator at the hotel and the stairs are very narrow, so if you plan to take a lot of luggage with you it might be a problem.

Stairs only, so i had to carry my huge luggage 4 levels up and substandard room with no aircon and it was quite dirty when i went in, like there was dirt on the floor and toilet paper on the floor in the toilet. Honestly i rather pay more to be in a nicer area. But its literally beside the metro so thats extremely convenient. And if you need halal food, its everywhere here!!! Also it came with very simple breakfast of croissants, bread, butter, nutella, jam, banana, cereal and juice to choose from. The 2nd night was extremely warm and having no fan was a killer. The bed was sinking in the middle and i was alone and the pillows were so flat. I could not sleep properly at all. Very disappointed stay. And there is no way to get help for the discomfort i was in.

1060,"Only drawback to this hotel is no lift, which, after a long trek around Paris, is hard going. We were on the 3rd floor and all floors are accessed by an old, but beautiful, spiral staircase. Check in was smooth, offered help with bags and given a printed map of where to locate car park. The Metro station is located directly outside the front door of the hotel which is great. however after climbing the steps of the Metro to then go up 3 floors is hard work, thank god I wasn't any higher up! For the Metro i would advise you buy a ""carnet"" of 10 tickets for 14,40 euros instead of 1,80 euros each! Room was comfortable and shared bathroom had a great shower. Our room also had a sink and hairdryer. Area was Moroccan/Egyptian/north African community mainly, but very friendly and great little cafes, restaurants and shops. Bakery (patisserie) near car park has the most amazing goods, croissant, cakes allsorts. Portugese custard tarts (Pastel du nata) were the best. All goods cheaper than in centre of Paris. We paid 3,50 euros for pain au chocolate, pain au raisin and a Portugese custard tart.

Facilities were good; nice clean sink area, hairdryer, TV, tea and coffee making facilities (with coffee and teabags!), fridge, safe, drawers and wardrobe area. Very modern decor and clean. We were on the 3rd floor which has a shared bathroom; this is also a shared toilet! I don't mind using a shared bathroom but found it a hassle to have 1 toilet on the floor. If you're someone who uses the toilet a lot in the night this is something to consider. Or when you're dying to go when you wake up but the bathroom is busy for ages! Overall I would recommend this hotel and would return. Room very modern and comfortable. The main thing to consider here is the rooms with a shared bathroom and toilet.

1065,"Six floor with no lift! The wooden spiral stairs not suitable for children and old. We stayed on the sixth floor, at first we were worried having to climb so many stairs, but when we saw the view over the roofs of other buildings we stayed put. We had our own bathroom. Clean room and bathroom. Tea and coffee facility with kettle. No milk. There is a fridge so you can buy a little carton from lidl near by. If you miss breakfast there is a nice bakery near by. Wifi ok. The hotel is near a cross road so it is noisy, but at late night it get quite.The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast consist of croissant, French dread, boiled egg, ham, fruit salad, jam, honey and Nutella. But is not replaced so you need to get there early. Nice coffee though. The best thing about the hotel is just outside one of the exit of Metro station Maraichers, on line 9, outskirts of Paris. The hotel is not right in the centre of the Paris, but with the fast Metro trains, this is not a huge problem. The problem is the hotel is not in a nice area, not the most prettiest part of Paris. Absolutely no nice restaurants in the area, we looked for one but didn't find one, the ones recommend in the area are horrible, eat in one of the restaurants on Rue Mouffetard, nearest metro Place Monge. Our train was late in the evening so the hotel let us keep our bags secure on one side. It would have cost us money if we had stored the bags at Gare du Nord. Cheaper to get few more Metro tickets to come back to collect the bags. Talking of the metro tickets buy 20 tickets for two for four days. Easy to buy with a card or Euros at the automatic machine, they are in English. At Gare du Nord don't queue with everyone on the station at the top, go down to the metro station and there are no queues.","May 28, 2016","20    Hotel de L'Union

1068,"In general, our impression from this hotel was very good. We stayed in Paris for a weekend and we would consider this hotel once again anytime. It had some pros, some cons, so I’d like to expalin it a bit more…PROS:Great location - although it takes some time to arrive to the city centre, Montmartre or Eiffel tower, the metro entrance is literally three steps from the hotel (line 9) (lines 1 & 2 are also just 5 minutes’ walk). Very nice and cozy interior - hotel is very nicely decorated, a bit smaller, but everything in place, everything clean and new. That's actually what we perceive as ""typical french style"", therefore we were very pleased with it.Friendly staff - although we met only one guy (at the reception and at breakfast) we absolutely cannot complain. He was polite, friendly and very helpful.Good price - Well, to be honest, it really is one of the less expensive possibilities in Paris. And for the value we got, very very nice prices.CONS: Very small interior - As I already mentioned, hotel is nicely decorated, but very very small. At least we had very small room, the corridors were also very tight and the staircase, wow, I've never seen something so small. Also the dining room was very small, but that's I guess normal in Paris (both restaurants we visited were also very small or let's say cozy)A bit cold room - I know we chose a bit strange date for visiting Paris (start of March), but even though we expected our room to be at least a bit warmer. The heating almost didn't work and therefore we had rather cold nights (but we slept well anyway =)6 floors without lift – We’re still young and had almost no luggage, but I can imagine that some older people with more luggage could have serious problems with very small staircase that leads all the way up to the 6th floor. Our room was at the 5th and it was something to get up there everytime =)A bit limited breakfast - We're actually not used to opulent breakfasts and specialties, but having to choose only between Nutella, jam and cereals is a bit limited even for us. I think it wouldn't take so much effort to get some ham, cheese or fruit/vegetable. The breakfast was very good, don't take me wrong, but it was every day the same, limited choice.----------------------So, just to sum up everything a bit. The hotel has a great location, very friendly staff and is nicely decorated. Unfortunately it is a bit smaller – small staircase, small rooms, small breakfast. With a bit of effort, I think at least the breakfast could be much better. Anyway for that price, I would surely recommend it to anyone looking for something different than standard IBIS.","March 7, 2016","20    Hotel de L'Union

1069,"We are a family with two kids - age 7 and 9. We were able to get a family room (double bed for Mom and Dad and two cots for the kids in one room). This made the price better and it was nice to have everyone in the same place. The room was very small but that did not bother us as it was just a place to sleep. It is right on Metro Line 9 which made it easy to get everywhere. (Half an hour or so to Eiffel tower, Musee d'Orlay etc). The included breakfast was excellent - croissant baked on site, bread, corn flakes, fruit salad, nutello and butter. We were also on the 5th floor and there is no elevator so be prepared to lug your suitcases up the a winding small staircase. The internet generally worked well although sometimes you had to be patient as it went in and out.Our two concerns. 1. It was supposed to be no-smoking but our room definitely smelled like smoke as did the hallway outside our room. We left the window open all day to try and air it out. They explained it must have been the person who stayed before us. If you are allergic to smoke or it really bothers you, don't stay here. 2. They had quoted us 94 Euros a night and then when I went to pay, explained there was a tax on top of this. It wasn't a lot (about 4 Euros a night) but I explained that that was something they should have included in the email. After talking they didn't make us pay the tax. Having said that, they were extremely friendly and if we were to go back to Paris, we would stay there again.","February 25, 2016","20    Hotel de L'Union

1073,"I was met by Kareem who was very pleasant, and assisted me by carrying my case to the 2nd floor (thank you Kareem, I appreciated the gesture after a long journey).A few days before arriving, there was a pre-authorisation on my Debit card for the full amount, not a problem and standard practice, but, although it was immediately cancelled by the hotel, (Kareem showed me the receipt), the money was still showing on my account as a pre-authorisation and so the funds were unavailble to me to pay my bill. This may not have been anything due to the hotel, however I recommend the hotel follow up to check the process so this can be avoided in the future. I travel a lot, and this was the first time it has happened. For info, I bank with CITIBANK. I was able to arrange for an additional transfer but just in case this could happy again, be aware - check with your bank before you arrive to ensure that any pre-authorisation has been completely cancelled so that funds are available to you when you arrive in Paris. As other reviewers have mentioned, the stairs are quite narrow (spiral staircase), and I can see how those who are not quite as young and fit as they used to be may struggle to carry large luggage to upper floors. However, the staff were very happy to help so don't be shy to ask for assistance if you need it. I believe the hotel does have plans to install a lift in the future, but it may not be for a while.The hotel is quite new, and the room I stayed in was a good size for Paris, furnished and finished to a good standard and a large bathroom (bath with shower) by Paris standards. I was in a double room on my own, the bed was a good size and very comfortable. However I think the room may be a bit cramped if you are 2 people with multiple suitcases. A fridge was provided and very much appreciated, something I personally feel should be standard in all hotels. The price paid was very competitive compared to the more central hotels, and if you don't mind a short metro ride, it could save you some money. Free wifi was sufficient for my needs, emails and some minor browsing, and signal strength was fine on the 2nd floor.I did not try the breakfast, however I was invited to have a coffee when checking out, and the breakfast room is quite nice. An espresso was very welcome before departing to the airport, thank you.Locally, there is a supermarket very close (turn right as you exit the hotel, 1 minute walk), and several fast food and restaurants available, although on this occasion I did not try any of them. There are several ATM's available close by.Pros - Pleasant staff, good location, furnished and finished to a good standard, good competitive price.Cons - Traffic noise. I was in a front facing room which is overlooking a busy junction. The first night I slept well, probably helped by the long flight, however, the remaining 2 nights, I was constantly woken by noisy traffic, trucks unloading, bikes/mopeds etc. This is not the fault of the hotel of course, the windows are insulated, but if you are a light sleeper, I would recommend a room not facing the main roads if they are available. If I am able to secure a quieter room next time, I will certainly return and fully recommend you give this hotel a try.","October 17, 2015","20    Hotel de L'Union

Because I arrived early, my room was not ready yet, but they offered to get a room ready sooner and stored my bag while I went to a nearby restaurant for lunch. When I returned, I was able to get into my room with a king-size bed. The room was reasonably large for a Paris hotel (smaller than American hotel rooms), it included a large desk with storage drawers, a small refrigerator, a comfortable lounge chair and side table, a closet with room to hang clothes as well as shelves, a safe, and a spacious bathroom with a tub/shower and side alcove for the toilet. The bed was comfortable, soft surface but firm enough underneath. The hotel has a bar and restaurant as well as a bright breakfast room that served a buffet each morning that included warm foods like eggs and meats, as well as cold foods such as yogurt, fruit, juices, breads, and toppings. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Metro/RER station at La Defense Grand Arch. There is a shopping mall and several restaurants in the area.

1077,"I stayed here for four nights in business, and it was absolutely perfect. Especially nice was the excellent service I received from everyone at the hotel. The rooms are quite spacious for Paris, and well-appointed. I enjoyed the Nespresso, and especially appreciated that the man restocking the coffee station left extras of my favorite coffee pods. The hotel was quiet and location made it easy to walk to the Metro. The neighborhood also offered good shopping, a grocery store and many nice restaurants to choose from.

1078,"My stay at the Renaissance was only one night but I wish it was longer. The hotel is excellently located on Avenue de Wagram (right on the RER and central to so much of Paris). Most rooms overlook a quiet courtyard with a picturesque view of Haussmann rooftops. Absolutely silent and blissful for recovering from jetlag. I received a welcome email in advance of my trip and had a very smooth and pleasant check-in (thanks for the coffee and croissants!). The room was faultless and every aspect of the hotel seemed smooth and polished. Unfortunately there was a taxi shortage on the day of my departure due to the Paris airshow, but the staff made this known in advance so other arrangements could be made.","June 26, 2019","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

1079,"We stayed 3 nights here and were generally happy with location and cleanliness. It took about an hour to reach the hotel from the airport via taxi as it was morning rush hour. The location is excellent! Steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the Charles de Gaulle etoile station and Champs Élysées.The room was spacious and very clean. We did not use any hotel services or the restaurant.The concierge team had emailed me prior to our arrival and I booked le louvre tickets and front of the line guided tour of Eiffel Tower with them. They confirmed everything via email and I felt this was a safer option than booking via trip advisor as I was not familiar with the company on trip advisor. Upon arrival at the hotel, they handed me an envelope with the tickets and the dates printed outside the envelope. I verified we had 2 tickets for each but I should have examined each ticket thoroughly. The louvre tickets were fine but the Eiffel Tower tickets had the wrong date printed on them. They stated May but we were in June. Not even sure how they would have printed a date that was already passed?? The company blamed the concierge and the concierge blamed the tour company. After wasting over an hour getting to the tower, waiting half an hour at the meeting point, then calling the tour company, we could not get in. Their later tour was sold out as were all tours for the following 3 days! The line at the tower was thousands of people deep so we left....angry and disappointed. After discussing the error with the hotel to great extent, we were obviously refunded for the tickets and they paid for our taxi to the train station the next day. It did not take away from our extreme disappointment at wasting a day and not going up the tower.The staff were polite and professional in dealing with our anger and disappointment.","June 9, 2019","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

1083,"My wife and I recently stayed here for three nights. Getting to the hotel from CDG was very easy and the hotel proactively sent directions for rail/metro one week before our arrival. Upon check in our room wasn’t ready but they did call us once it was. Hotels often say they will but then did not follow up, so kudos to them for this. We were also given a card for a welcome drink but they did not explain that it was for beer or wine only. Our cocktails that were ordered didn’t qualify. Strange that they wouldn’t mention this. We had a larger suite that we used confirmed suite night upgraded. When I say larger this is in European terms. Overall the suite was small. The decor on the the walls was heavy wood paneling. It gave the space a dated feel. The bathroom was large with a tub shower combo. However there wasn’t a shower curtain, rather a small glass partition that didn’t do nearly enough to keep the water in the tub when showering. As such most of the towels went to mop up duty. The best part of the room by far was the balcony. It had views of both the Arc and the Eiffel Tower. It also has a small table and two chairs. The only meal we ate at the hotel was breakfast and it let something to be desired. One morning the eggs were half cooked and runny. I get this is a thing in many parts of the world, but the next day they were way over cooked and brown. The fruit juices were fresh squeezed but had separated and would not flow thru the jars they were using. The breakfast meats were also over cooked. In the future I would suggest having breakfast outside of the hotel. I would return to the hotel but would adjust my expectations.","May 4, 2019","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

1084,"Arrived at the Renaissance Paris hotel just after Christmas, and of course the hotel was decorated fantastically. Seriously what else would you expect ? The Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel is of course a very cool place like most of the Renaissance line. Upon walking in, the bell staff offered assistance, and helped us to the front desk. The Staff at the front desk were of course very cool and very professional staff. The Check-in couldn't have been smoother. We received our room keys and ventured up to the room. Upon entering the room.. this is where the wheels feel off of the great experience. We walked in and we thought the room was under renovation. There were a few boards laying on the floor. I called the front desk and they said they'd send maintenance up to look into it. The Maintenance guy looks at it, and says, ""you need a new room"", he indicated he could clean it up, but that we should really get a better room for having to deal with this. So far we hadn't really dealt with anything. So I went down to the front desk, explained what was going on. Immediately the front desk gal says... that's no good, let's see... and she says, yes, let's upgrade you to (insert room level that I can't remember now). I get the keys, we haul our luggage to our new room... oh ya... The room faces Wagram, and in the background above the buildings.. ya, the Eiffel Tower. So much better than our back alley view from the prior room. The room was very modern, very clean and a fantastic view. Even though the room faced the busy street, the noise was minimal. The Renaissance doesn't have a club lounge like other Marriott properties, but the front desk gave us vouchers for breakfast in the restaurant. Even though we were a party of 4, we had enough vouchers for all of us. The breakfast was a buffet, and definitely one of the better breakfasts buffets I've experienced. The restaurant staff were, just like the front desk staff, professional and very good. Overall, I REALLY like the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, and would absolutely go back when I go back to Paris again. The Renaissance, just like all of Paris, just knows how to class things up. The location of the Renaissance is fabulous as well. Very easy to walk to most everything or nearby metro stop.","April 28, 2019","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

1087,"Stayed here for 3 nights on a quick stay in Paris with my wife and two little girls (3 & 18 months). Decided to cash in on some suite night awards and was not disappointed. Some folks are saying they are having problems redeeming them but I couldn’t have been happier with my upgrade on this stay. Upgraded to the Arc De Triomphe/Eiffel Tower view suite and, holy crap, was it awesome! Really enjoyed the terrace and the views. Plenty of room for us and the kids. I was also really impressed with the staff, especially the restaurant staff! Mary was super helpful with breakfast and also had some great recommendations for Paris and Normandy, where we were headed next. Speaking of breakfast, I thought that was great as well. I’m always hesitant when going to a nice hotel with small kids but everyone went out of their way to make them feel welcomed as well. The restaurant staff brought them a cool little kids pack with a bunch of activities and stickers - this was most greatly appreciated. Before I set off on this trip to Switzerland and France I was on the fence about my loyalty to Marriott. After my experience at this hotel I couldn’t be more impressed!

They are a true asset to the property. The decor of the lobby now a little underwhelming; however, who is there for the hotel lobby? My room was spacious, clean, and comfortable; the pillows were perfect. I did eat at the hotel bar a couple of nights, $17 USD for a shot of Makers is outrageous; next time I will bring my own. The food was good, and the conversation with bar tenders was great. Before I settle in to work, I wanted to see part of the city, so I set out walking. The Arc is right there, and it is an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower, and down the Seine toward Notre Dame, and back to the hotel. Paris turned out to be a lot different than I expected. My great time there started and ended with the hotel staff. -- J'espère que ça se passe bien dans mon français.

1100,"Member of the Marriott reward program for many years now, I stayed in several of the hotels from this brand (Renaissance, JW Marriott, etc) and am satisfied with the overall quality of the service offered.This hotel is good as well but I am a bit surprised with the fact that it belongs to one of their highest categories (which means highest standards etc). Its location is great, located on avenue de Wagram, it is 5mins away from Champs d’Elysées. The staff members are welcoming, helpful, and a pleasure to interact with. However we encountered a few things which affected the experience there and I wouldn’t have expected in such a place. Among those, the sink in the bathroom was almost blocked and it was hard to evacuate even a small amount of water. There was also the lobby which had a weird smell (maybe due to an issue in the WC located their) and does not give a very good first impression of the place. A couple of other points are not up to a 5 star hotel: issues with the lifts ( one out of the two working only), soundproofing which could be improved, 20mins to bring the luggage to our room. The city view from the prestige room was limited, i expected more.In a nutshell, convenient hotel which could benefit from few refurbishments and improvements of the way things are operated for the maintenance of its parts to offer a great customer experience.","November 10, 2018","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

1101,"This was our second visit to Paris and to the Renaissance Arc de Triomphe. Our first visit years ago was so charming and welcoming that we had to come again for our return visit. Though this second time didn't start as well with the lack of upgrades available at the time of check-in, they were able to eventually accommodate us with their best room on the top floor due to issues in the original room. We remembered the breakfast as amazing a few years ago and the quality seemed to have declined this time around. The housekeeping quality has definitely declined with missing refresh of toiletries and other lack of attention to detail. Beyond that, the hospitality is wonderful and the staff always welcoming and helpful. While we usually stay at higher end properties, this Renaissance's proximity to the Arc and the Champs is ideal. The metro station is a few steps away. The Rue Poncelot market is also within walking distance.

1106,"We just spent five nights at this hotel. The hotel itself is clean but very dated. The problem, I think, is that the owners are not willing to spend the money to update because of the poor neighborhood. We walked almost 50 miles in Paris and didn't see anywhere as bad as this. Bums were sprawled across the side walk at 8:30 in the morning and at 14:30 in the afternoon. All along the street are people sleeping or begging. This was enough to keep me away from this hotel, but I should also warn about the breakfast. We tried the 30 euro breakfast our first morning. The buffet had cold eggs, cold sausage and potatoes that were like cold chips of wood. You are not allowed to get your own coffee and I had to almost tackle a waiter to get served.

1109,"My three college girlfriends and I spent 10 nights at the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel earlier this month. It has been many years since we graduated and we take a trip each year to celebrate our friendship....this year marked 46 years since we met. The hotel had asked in advance the purpose of our trip and I responded with information. They used the information to decorate our room and put friendship signs and balloons up. It was very welcoming and thoughtful. Laura Marucci, one of the hotel's guest experience managers, made sure our room was set up with robes, slippers, champagne glasses and a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us. Each person we interacted with throughout our stay was extremely attentive and focused on customer service...the front desk staff, the breakfast staff, the bar staff, housekeeping...We could not have been more pleased and we made sure to leave handwritten notes to compliment the staff on their excellent service. Next year I'm planning to return to Paris with my husband and we will definitely be staying at Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel. C'était merveilleux!","September 28, 2018","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

1110,"First trip to Paris and after much research settled on the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe. Our room was spacious and overlooked the city, with a view that included the very top of the Eiffel Tower. Two metro lines (#2 and #6) are within a few blocks walk, enabling access to the entire city. If you are Rewards member, be advised there is no concierge lounge located at this property. But they do provide a free breakfast as compensation, or points. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. While not impacting the quality of the stay at all, the red and blue lights in the elevator are extremely odd! ","September 22, 2018","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

Fantastic staff that go out of their way to assist and help you at all times, Beyond friendly and with wonderful English too. As a Platinum member with Marriott, we got to enjoy breakfast each morning in their café. Once again, great service and a very wide selection of food - hot, cold, for sure, with a superb selection of bread and of course, croissants and really, anything you could want to fuel up to start the day.Beds were very comfortable, shower was hot and we had not one complaint the entire time.

1114,"First off the hotel is located 5mins from the arc de triumph and with many good restaurants and bakeries near by. The front desk staff and concierge are all welcoming and very knowledgeable about the area. The rooms are large for European standard. Here is where it fell short for a five star hotel and the price you pay I would expect them to get this right. First off the room service forgot to give us toilet paper one day so we had to call for that, they forgot to replenish our “2 complimentary waters 2 days and forgot to give us mouth wash and shower caps. The shower also was a poor design. Water kept of leaking onto the floor so we had to put towels down to prevent water from getting all over. No door to slide, shut or anything to prevent water from going onto the floor. The breakfast buffet was ok but the hot items were only luke warm. I know this may be knit picking but for the price and it being a 5 star hotel those things shouldn’t be a issue. ","September 8, 2018","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

1121,When we arrived with our bags we thought there was no bellman but there was and he just watched us take our 6 bags into the check in area. We had a nice lady who spoke perfect English who checked us into a room quickly and when we arrived at the room it smelled of cigar smoke. We tried to call front desk but there was no answer. We proceeded to front desk to be told it was a no smoking hotel and could not understand why we thought it smelled like smoke. The best they could do was downgrade our room or bring us a ozone machine for the room. Since we did not want to have to lug our luggage through hotel again we took the machine. Over the next 7 nights housekeeping forgot to clean our room twice and the ice makers never did work and to get ice we went downstairs to the bar as to get it sent up took 2 hours the first time. Our Included breakfast every morning was filled with poor quality generic foods and a coffee machine that only worked about half the time. It seemed the hotel was understaffed with good people as there seemed to be a lot of people working there but nobody doing there job. Maybe the boss was on vacation? You would think at such a high rating it would be so much better.

1122,"After researching all the Marriott and SPG properties in Paris, we finally decided on the Renaissance Arc de Triomphe. We were glad we did for many reasons. First, their warm hospitality and superb customer service. Sara at the front desk was the first person we met upon arrival to Paris and she made us feel totally welcomed. Fouade, the bellman, went the extra mile to help us with uber, taxi, and directions. The entire staff, including the reception, concierge, belldesk, and breakfast staff were friendly and helpful. Secondly, their location is unparalleled. Only 5 minutes walk to Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe. Also 5 minutes walk to two metro lines. Many good restaurants within walking distance, including Le Hide and L’Atelier du Marche. Avoid pricey tourist traps on Champs Elysees.Thirdly, the rooms and bathrooms were modern and comfortable. Their beds were a tad harder than what we’re used to in the States but we slept well.Finally, their buffet breakfast (complimentary for SPG/Marriott gold) was a fabulous way to start the day. We enjoyed the fresh fruits, juices, fresh croissants, hot chocolate, almond milk, yogurts, and cheeses. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!","August 3, 2018","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

1123,"We had booked at the Marriott Champs Elysees about 8 months ago. I have been watching the reviews of that property slipping. I even reached out to the hotel with concerns and they didn’t adequately address them. A week before leaving home I was able to book this Renaissance and am glad I did. I have a family of 5. We needed two rooms. Despite needing to have a room change due to fact it had been smoked in, They were able to put us together/ side by side; not connecting. We had a tiny balcony with garden view. The rooms were bigger than I was expecting. ( not big but larger than I have had in NYC). Housekeeping was wonderful. We have nothing ill to say of the breakfast buffet and we stayed 5 nights As mentioned, the staff were all wonderful. Only bit of a surprise was that children under 18 are not included in room rate (apparently in Europe it is under 12 and under,thus we had to pay a supplement each night)","July 30, 2018","21    Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel

I know about 30 French words, most of them not so helpful, and they all knew enough English to help me out. The concierges (there were 2) were excellent. Patient and helpful beyond expectation. Believe me, I had a million questions and they were just the best. Unexpectedly we were there for the World Cup (Allez Les Bleu!) It got pretty crazy out there and the staff were very protective of us and managed to get us a cab to the airport early the next morning despite the craziness.

1128,"Located right next to the Saint-Lazare railway hub this hotel is not quiet and not suitable for the summer. The hotel has no aircon and the dyson fan in the room is not a solution as it is only blowing hot air... Additionally, my room had no black out curtain, which for a room facing East is quite deplorable except if you want the sun rise to wake you up.Sadly, the previous comments made about the poor breakfast have not been useful to the management. Located in the basement, the narrow breakfast room was dirty, its buffet not refilled while two staff ladies were eating their own breakfast grabbing whatever was left... You literally had to go bother them to get something.I had requested a quiet room only to be positioned on the last floor right next to the elevator!The Staff does not take feedback with a proper attitude.

1129,"Just got home from staying here from a 3 night / 4 day trip to Paris.Paris itself is very easy to navigate through the metro system. And you can buy a pass for €8.95 euros a day which allow you in zones 1-5 and on buses too! There are 2 stations within short walking distance to the hotel - these are Rome and Europe. Very handy and easy to find!There is a convenience shop at the end of the road from the hotel which is handy. As the breakfast is contenential - mostly bread , pastries and a little selection of hot food like sausages and scrambled egg but it didn’t look very nice. And one of our party members tried it and said it wasn’tvery nice. Can’t conplain for the price though! The beds were very comfy and the showers did what showers do. On top of the beds there are plugs for your phone which is handy - and little lamps. the Wardrobe space isn’t a lot but you get around 7 hangers which does the job. We were greeted at reception by a lovely man! Who was very helpful and friendly and we had no problems checking in or finding our rooms. The rooms also come with fans to cool down, and there is a hair dryer in the bathroom! Upon leaving the hotel we paid city tax which was about 11.50 per room which wasn’t too bad. Again, very friendly on reception even offered to get us a taxi to the airport but we had train tickets :) there is also a bar in reception and different seating areas. Overall, a comfortable stay with a very ideal location to central Paris, easy to navigate!

1130,"We visited here as the reviews had said that it was a friendly area and can completely agree. It’s off the main road down a side street so benefits from being in a quiet location, but is near enough to a big main street with lots of restaurants bars and sites.The Moulin Rouge was a 15 minute walk and the hotel offered umbrellas as it was a rainy evening when we walked there from the hotel.We also picked this hotel as there is a Metro station less than a 5 minute walk which we used a lot to get around. It’s about 5 or 10 minutes (on the metro) to the Champ Elyse and Arc de Triumph.The room was spacious enough and had a fridge and all the other amenities you’d expect and the hotel staff spoke perfect english which was great as we only spoke a little french.Would consider again if we returned to Paris, but bear in mind that the hotel is outside of the centre of Paris so travel is needed with taxis or Metro if you wanted to go to the likes of the Eiffel Tower (if you didn’t fancy an hour walk!)","January 24, 2019","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

1131,"Hotel Cervantes is big on value especially for its central location in Paris. I paid about an average for Euro67 a solo room, which is one of the more affordable rates that I can find in the area. The hotel is in middle two metro stations on Line 2: Rome and Liege and I was surprised to find out that it was just a 15-minute walk to the Opera shopping district: Paris Garnier Opera House, Galeries Layfette and Printemps department stores - with the help of Google Maps. However, one must be willing to overlook some parts. The hotel room is dated but decently furnished - there is even a fridge, safe, portable side table (perfect for eating by the bed while watching television) and stools. However, the room’s brown carpet can be a put-off as it is in a murky brown colour. Well, wearing your own in-room slippers should solve this problem. I love the extra perks of the hotel lobby, such as free tea and coffee and drinks and snack station in the cosy and beautifully decorated lobby.Service staff is also friendly and willing to help. I had problems accessing the hotel’s Wifi network on my mobile phone, and the staff went out of their way to make sure that I received wifi connection. Another bonus on the trip was that I was given a room that faces the quiet Rue De Berne, which seems to be a residential area and it comes with a mini balcony. Perfect for sitting and enjoying the view with my baguette tradition (bought from the two nearby boulangeries - Boulangerie Julien and another one in the Batignolles area). There is a Carrefour City supermarket three minutes away, which makes it easy to buy water and groceries. A good base for exploring Paris. And sometimes, you just feel like hanging out in this hotel for a relaxing retreat.","December 8, 2018","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

I had read reviews with regards to their being no air conditioning but knew that we would be supplied with a fan.. our room was nice nothing fancy but perfect for a base to sleep and freshen up... the bathroom was on the small side but that’s about all I can find fault with.. we actually had two fans in our room which was even better as I keep the fan on 365 days of the year... our room backed onto the metro but that wasn’t even an issue at all.. we could open the window and not be worried about anyone looking in... we found the bed super comfy.. we were a little way from where we wanted to be but once we found a route it took about 1 hour to walk to the Eiffel Tower... we only wished we could have had another two nights here so that we could go the other way to explore more of what Paris had to offer... all in all we were more than happy with this hotel and would certainly stay here again.. obviously it may not be everyone’s cup of tea but for us it was just right.. all I would say is maybe a little bit of attention could be made to the decor as it was a bit damaged in places but again wasn’t a problem for us... thank you for a wonderful experience ,"September 10, 2018","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

Booked a premium room which was clean and tidy but could do with a re-vamp. Breakfast was a cold buffet selection which was fresh and tasty.

First we checked in later in the night because our flight got delayed, when we get to our room the lock was not working, we had to go down and have the front desk guy open the door with the key because the card reader was not working, the next morning I went to have breakfast and I still needed the staff to open the door of my room everytime I had to goin and out of the hotel. 2nd the hotel DOES NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONER, I specially look for hotels with air conditioner because I know in Europe a lot of places don’t have it. They promote trip advisor all over the hotel and trip advisor says they have air conditioner but they DO NOT HAVE. I spoke to the manager Hadrien who explained that they do not have air and they never had it, I asked for something to be done and he said he was going to talk to Claire [-------] about it and that she will determine if I could get a discount or refund and I am still waiting for her call. She was suppose to call me the day after because she was not working on that Monday. The front guy told us the previous night that at the time is not working that a technician is suppose to come to fix it (which was not true because they do nonot have have air conditioner) he brought a fan full of dust for us to use which was our salvation and sleeping spills every night. Third if there is no air conditioner you cannot open the windows because you can hear all the noise of the train, which I understood why they have earplugs in the room for use. 4th the bathroom was dirty, the tile walls had mold all over (see my pictures), I showed this to the manager who said he was going to talk to Claire which I am still waiting for the call. 5th we paid for the breakfast, first morning we went down around 9:30 (breakfast is 7-10am) there was barely anything left, I asked the lady for more croissant and she said they were no more left, asked for more yogurt and got the same answer. There was barely anything left. So I said well let’s go earlier the next day, we went around 8:30am and similar story. I have stayed all over the world and have never received a there is no more in any hotel you pay for breakfast. the breakfast room is very small, HOT and obviously feels crowded, we had to go to the outside to pay and eat because we barely got anything besides cereal. It is a continental very basic breakfast. Lastly carpets were disgusting dirty, chairs broken, pillows dirty,definitely this place needs improvement in terms of the facilities. I will NOT recommend it or ever go back to it. I booked it because of the reviews. Don’t be fooled by the good reviews.","June 8, 2018","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

1141,"Stayed for a week in April. Hotel is on on a quiet street close to three metro stations. So easy to get anywhere around Paris as they are all on different lines. Metro is easy to negotiate and really convenient. Walk towards Liege for lots of restaurants. We ate at L'affiche close to hotel and had a great meal.We had a superior room and couldn't fault it. Liked the green idea to opt out of having the room cleaned every day. Just hang out the card on the door. Breakfast was a continental buffet and more than adequate. Sometimes not as much choice if you went down later.The staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful. We used the hotel shuttle back to the airport to save taking cases on metro. Good service, bear in mind the taxi picks up at several hotels so allow time for this.To save queuing at attractions we bought tickets at tourist information near the Louvre. They said they charge a commission. We bought tickets for three attractions and train tickets to Versailles and the charge was under 2 euros.Would definitely recommend this hotel for a city break, loved it.","May 10, 2018","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

1144,"We stayed as part of a third party deal. We received a warm welcome and were able to leave our luggage securely prior to check in time and on departure and returned when it was time to travel home.The hotel is a short 3 minute walk from the Rome metro station. We were able to walk to several attractions such as the Sacre-Cour, Moulin Rouge and the Arc d Triumph. There were various restaurants nearby within easy walking distance for evening meals.The room was clean, generally well presented with hair drier fixed unit in bathroom, kettle and a safe. The bed was very comfortable. Our room was to the front of the hotel and was quiet. We were not aware of trains from the railway station behind.There was a coffee making machine in the foyer that hotel guests were free to use. Continental breakfast was provided between 07:00 and 10:00. The eating area was small and found downstairs in a basement area. It was perhaps a little cramped and could get quite busy. There were TVs broadcasting the breakfast news programmes. We enjoyed our stay and certainly would recommend as well return another time.","April 6, 2018","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

I've stayed in a number of hotels in the 8th as it's close to our office.The Cervantes represents great value for money and is a worthy 3 star. I've stayed in worse 4 star. It's conveniently located for St Lazare, Europe, Rome and Place de Clichy metro stops and is well served by the bus. There are plenty of bars and restaurants and the area feels safe late at night considering it's proximity to the red light district.It's sits on a quiet street and my inward facing room meant that the train noise from didn't bother me.The room was clean and comfortable although the bathroom was tiny. Not that much of an issue. The aircon was good and quiet. Breakfast was fine and there was plenty of it. The Wifi was also good.The free Nespresso machine in the lobby was welcome and the staff were friendly.I'm actually booking a weekend in May here on the strength of my previous experience.","March 27, 2018","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

1146,"Hotel is located at the 8th arr. , with many restaurants and brasseries 5-10 min walk. good location if you don't want the crowded over toured neighbourhoods. access is also great with 2 nearby metro staations (Rome, Europe). i had a mixed experience with the hotel. to start, the room is quite small (solo), also the shower with almost no space to move. but taking into account that this is paris, let's say OK. also LCD TV is quite large (27"") with good HD quality and wide selection (too bad on movies in english - why do europeans so obsessed with dubbing movies - that i'll never understand). who's interested in hearing someone in a studio overdubbing the real actor (!?) Ok, not hotel's fault -:) but let guests have some native english movies, it is, after all the most spoken language in the western world isn't it? regarding the room- could be much better. carpet seems stained and old. soap dispenser in bath was not replenished after request , which is NOT OK. which is a pity because the only time it had soap in it was wonderful using it! the bed is quite big and comfortable but the pillows - soft, with no firm option. i hate soft pillows...are there guests with no neck at all?...-:). the lobby area is really charming with free espresso and tea. real welcoming. i must indicate that having said that all the staff guys (and girls) i ran into were great - helping, smiling and willing to help (minus the dispenser incident...)). for the price paid this place has great potential.","February 23, 2018","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

1147,"Hotel is in a quiet back road. On arrival there was a pleasant, small reception area and the staff were very friendly and welcoming - but that, unfortunately, is where the good bits end. We were given a room on 5th Floor and due to the main lift being out of action were offered use of a small service lift - barely large enough for two people. Corridors both on ground level and outside our room were cluttered with large bags of hotel linen and cleaning items - which remained in situ throughout our stay. Our room was extremely small and the bathroom even smaller!!! The bathroom offered minimal space and had cracked tiles and a broken shower. Our room was at the back of the hotel and was above the railway line and so there was rail noise until late at night and restarting in the early morning.There were coffee/tea making facilities in the room however the only cups for hot drinks were plastic and completely unsuitable. We chose not to take the option of breakfast during our stay preferring to eat out so am unable to comment on this. It was well placed for sight-seeing and plenty of places to eat within easy reach. I will definitely return to Paris but I will not be staying here again and would not recommend it to others.","February 21, 2018","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

Most museums and montmarte is within walking distance around 30 minutes + but you see a lot while getting there. or just take the metro.The staff is awesome! Luis Marcos, thank you for all the tips and directions and most important, thanks for helping me with my room safe! Everyone at the front desk speaks great english. and are always more than happy to answer any questions and help out however they can. the rooms are ok. quite comfortable but on the smaller side. our room was way at the back and behind us was a train station of some sort, its loud when the windows are open but once you close them, it gets pretty quiet. so no worries there. The bed is ok as long as you are not over 6 feet tall. The complimentary wifi is fast and stable. Our room came with breakfast and it was good and filling. Love their coffee and croissants. and the nespresso machine at the lobby is a big plus!I also found out that tap water is ok to drink. they have 2 bottles of water in the fridge that are not free so make sure you confirm before you drink! They also have a fix rate taxi and shuttle service to CDG airport which is a big plus! i definitely recommend it unless you want to pay more for Uber and regular taxis. if you want to take the trains from CDG its also possible RER B to Gare du Nord, then the #2 (blue)line to Rome station. we took the fix fare taxi on the way back because it was raining hard that day.I would definitely stay here again.

The staff are very kind and friendly - nothing is to much trouble. There is a good selection of food on offer at breakfast. We travelled on Eurotunnel - I had never thought I would ever travel on this - having done so, I cannot imagine why anyone would travel from Britain to Paris by any other means. The train journey from Kingscross to Paris is surprisingly short and you arrive in the centre of Paris - no tiresome journey from the airport, so on a short break, you can really take advantage of all the time you have. On the way back we left our luggage in the lock-up at Gare Du Nord - again, very good value, and well worth it if you want to make the most of a short break.

1164,"Have just returned back from a five nights stay at Hotel Cervantes by Happy Culture.. we booked a triple room so i believe that's the biggest room at the hotel, which had enough space for 2 adults, a 5 year old kid & a toddler to move around comfortably.The pro's:-- Very good location, just a couple of minutes away from Rome metro station, also pretty close to Europe & Leige stations, so ur actually very well connected to different metro lines & RER too. 4 stops away from Champs Elysees & only 3 stops from the Sacre Coeur.- The staff are super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, very pleasant indeed (specially that one receptionist who comes from india who i unfortunately cant remember his name !)- They'll provide free umbrellas if its rainy, also free mineral water supply during happy hour at 6 pm i believe. Free lollipops and candies for the little kids which they were super happy with.- Clean, modern & just what you need for sleeping comfortably after a long exhausting day of sightseeing and shopping.- Carrefour just around the corner. - Trustworthy housekeeping (see con's to know why)Con's:-- Very poor wifi at the rooms (although pretty strong at the lobby area)- our safe box didn't work. We couldn't enter our password and it kept giving an error. We informed the reception and they promised to fix it next day. But Frankly speaking we were usually too excited in the mornings to get started with our program, and too exhausted at the end of the day to let someone inside to fix it. so we didn't bother to ask them for fixing it again. So cant really blame them for that. We left our passports and cash at the broken safebox, and i was super impressed with the honesty of the housekeeping.. thumbs up for choosing the right stuff.. but still it's not nice for a 4* hotel to leave safe boxes unmaintained. - I read on previous reviews that some rooms had A/C problems.. luckily our A/C worked perfectly for the first 5 days, and only broke on the day of checkout... we were already just packing and leaving, so again we didnt make a fuss.. but seems that A/C needs maintenance too IMPORTANT:- i read many reviews rating the hotel as noisy due to its location near Rome metro station, that some guests couldn't even sleep !!! I was a bit bothered with these reviews specially that i was traveling with my little daughters and i thought about changing the hotel at the last minute. But i am glad i didnt.. Please dont believe this.. the hotel is very quiet and we never heard railway noise (although our room faced the main street not the back) All in all, i would fully recommend this hotel to anyone.. i work as a honeymoon specialized travel agent in Cairo, Egypt.

The bed was comfortable, TV was a good size (though we were out every day) and the shower was warm. We didn't have a view from our room but you can't have everything. The Happy Hour is great!!!! Wine tasting, prosciutto, cheese, bread and jam for free every day from 6-8! Can't go wrong. The staff were great!!! So nice and helpful. They capped off the experience at this hotel. We wouldn't hesitate to stay again. ","June 30, 2017","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

1169,"We were drawn in by the price, but a bit disappointed by several things--our window leaked water, so there was an unfortunate mildew smell in our small, double room that dogged us the entire visit. Our safe was broken, the refrigerator never truly cooled off, the AC wasn't sufficient, the elevator was an oven, both the hot water in the shower and the wifi were spotty, and the ""unlimited"" coffee didn't actually include the good cappucino in the basement breakfast room--it was limited to the subpar espresso machine in the hotel lobby. They were also skimpy with the water bottles--they were supposed to put 2 in our fridge each day, but we actually had to go downstairs to request them, and they didn't always have them.So, yeah, we got a good price, but a good value? Not so much.","June 9, 2017","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

1170,Stayed 3 nights and liked the informal atmosphere of the hotel. Reception staff very helpful. Very handy for Rome Metro at the end of the road. Good supermarket on the corner of Rue De Moscou. Room was small but clean and tidy with a useful fridge for beer and water ! Free room safe. At the back of the hotel the view was not great but nice sunset from balcony. Breakfast was a little cramped downstairs but food was sufficient. We were told we could use the facilities at other Happy Hotels in the city but we did not make it to them. Free refreshments in bar including wine in the evening. Would recommend this for location and friendliness.,"June 4, 2017","22    Hotel Cervantes by HappyCulture

The receptionist assured us that the AC would be checked by a technician the next day, but it wasn´t. The next day the other recepcionist told us that the AC would be fixed in a month. It seems like the AC was broken and thats the reason they put a fan in the room.

We paid for a flexible booking should they not be able to travel for some reason. this meant that payment should have been taken on leaving - rather than in advance. Instead, they immediately took the funds, and it was a battle to get it back. We also booked a premier room given that this was a celebration. Our parents suspected this isnt what they had been given, but were told it was while they were in the hotel. When they got back they checked online and it clearly was a standard room. Very disappointing lack of good faith all round, especially for them to have raised this and been misled in this way. Some money was later refunded, but that is not the point.

It is very different from an American experience of a hotel but I absolutely loved it! The streets are all cobblestone and the hotel is situated on a side street between Paris apartments. The location was EXCELLENT! The Rome Metro station was only a block away from the hotel. So easy to get around the city using the Metro. The day we arrived after traveling overnight from the US the staff welcomed us and made us coffee while we waited for our hotel room to be ready as we were there early. The coffee was free and available daily. The staff was so welcoming and helpful daily through out our trip. Every day they helped us navigate the Metro to our desired locations. They would take out the Metro map and give us detailed instructions on how to get to our desired trip. They spoke excellent English as well as Spanish and French. Their helpfulness and kindness was so appreciated and in such a stark contrast to assumptions about travel in France. We miss all of you already. They also had a lot of great suggestions of things to do as well as places to eat that were close by. Thank you all so much for an amazing stay in Paris France!

1183,"I stayed in this hotel for two times.Among the expensive and or old and tired hotel choices in Paris, HM is a good option - it is much more reasonably priced, it is of modern design, clean and relatively newly renovated (I stayed in the ground floor room and loved it). It has a kitchen with full cooking utensils in great clean condition. Sizeable shower area and bathtub (unlike some hotel you can hardly move). Queen size bed. It is 10 min walk to La Marais one of my favourite shopping area with local designers shops, 4-5 Maje/Sandro and reasonable priced restaurants. Actually one of my favourite Michelin 3 stars L’Ambroise is also there.What I love most is also service. They served by couple of young ladies. Not traditional 24 hour conceige. They are not in the conceige all the time. But they are friendly, flexible, digitally savvy (young) and we make requests and they quickly responsed and met your need with flexibility. If you are relatively young and use to quick text and arrangement you will find it very friendly and agile. If one expect a traditional 24 hour conceige you may be horrified why no one is around.They went extra mile and help make my trip smooth and more enjoyable. Along a few things, I booked two different rooms for my last stay. they let me stayed in my original room as it is available so I don’t need to move although the second room is supposed to be cheaper. It is not obligated and therefore appreciated. Big hotel with “policy” will not have that human touch.It is a small boutique hotel in the alley.

I hate vegetarian cuisine and never eat it, but this place works magic and i would go there weekly if I could. Ask the hotel owner for the name--it's just about next door. If you're going to be in Paris for a night, a weekend, a few days or more, do your best to book a room here. I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I visit Paris.

1205,"The hotel has just been fully redecorated with a new contemporary style. It is stylish and modern. Nicely done.We stayed in La Suite. The room was spacious (a good thing in Paris!). It even had a little kitchen fully equipped if you fancy having a night-in (including a dishwasher and a Nespresso coffee machine) and a good sofa to relax after a long day in Paris.I heard they were adding a Spa in the vaulted basement. We could not see it but we are looking forward to trying it at our next visit!The hotel is located in a charming quiet cobbled street right in the Marais - one of the best neighbourhoods in Paris. It is very easy to move around by foot, metro or taxi. There are plenty of good restaurants around too.","November 20, 2016","23    Hotel du Haut Marais

1206,"We booked the hotel to celebrate our 10 years anniversary so we wanted a cosy place in the heart of Paris to visit places just by walking. The hotel is very well located but in a pedestrian street so it's very quiet. The owner explained us that the hotel has just been totally redesigned and it's is very striking how each details has been chosen with a lot of taste. The appartement are comfortable and quiet, we felt at home. We were lucky to see the owner that made everything possible so that we have a good time in her hotel. Definitely a very good address in Paris, we will come back to try the sauna once it's finished!","November 19, 2016","23    Hotel du Haut Marais

1208,"Quite a way out from the city centre; this makes it cheaper, but if you can get your head around the metro system, there are trains running almost constantly and Riquet station is a two minutes walk away. Right by side of canal so a nice view if on that side of hotel. Room was nice and clean and breakfast was okay except for the eggs!The local area seems a bit run down in places and the rancid smell of pee is too prevalent around some of the streets. However, sitting by the canal in the evening is pleasant and the people are friendly. I would use this hotel again.","July 11, 2019","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

1210,"This is one hotel which you will love only for its location. It is bang next to the canal and from the room windows or from the open deck, you can find many sailboats. Try to choose a lower floor room, which will give you an early morning feel that you are lying on the water level of the canal.There is not much else to write about the room or the bathroom, both of which are small. There were not enough power sockets in the room and I had to charge the batteries from the bathroom. Having toiletries of ""standard"" brand was an added change.Breakfast was complementary, good, but became a bore within our 4 nights stay. It would be nice if the cook learns to make scrambled eggs which are less watery.In a nutshell. the family just loved it and would be happy to stay there again :-)","June 25, 2019","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

I heard some great reviews of Veena World through a friend of mine and was willing to give it a try. Since it was our annual family trip, I decided to keep things simple. With their customization options, we were able to filter results according to our preferences.

1213,"I have stayed at this hotel 4 or 5 times now and have always thought it to be a hidden gem. The rooms are large by Paris standards and well priced and it's on the side of the Saint-Martin Canal at the Bassin de la Villette.The hotel is well maintained and offers a really good breakfast with quality items and a wide variety of choice. Staff are generally friendly and efficient and speak many languages - English being the main one after French.Usually, I would give the hotel a 5-star rating, but it's much less as I feel their professionalism left a lot to be desired on my last visit.After checking out I asked for a taxi only to be told that they were on strike. This was the first I knew of this as no signs had been posted in the elevators or foyer. When I asked the woman at the desk what we could do she said to take the Metro. This to a person with 2 suitcases of around 25 kgs each and a handicapped wife who can't walk too far. After I pressed her for a solution she said she'd see what her manager had to say and went into the office behind the desk. The manager had such high concern for our situation that he didn't even bother to come out to us. When the clerk returned she said she would try and get a taxi and used the computer to make a booking. I asked how long the taxi might be and she said she didn't know. All through our conversation, she showed little if any empathy for our plight.Thank goodness for phone apps as I was able to get a car from Kapten which got us to the airport in good time for our plane.As I said this is a good hotel. But I have given it a poor rating because of the low level of professionalism and customer service when it was needed most. Also, because I received an email with a half-apology from the manager saying that staff would be counseled, but that there were signs in the lift - there were not. And that another client had got a taxi earlier after waiting 45 minutes and it took 2 hours to the airport. What relevance this has to our situation escapes me, but I find it passing strange that the manager knows how long a cab took to get to the airport. I actually believe he's not telling the truth, but who cares?A professional manager would have arranged for signs to be in elevators, all foyers, and the breakfast room. They would also arrange some form of bookable transport to be available. They would talk with their customers and not hide in their office.So stay at this great hotel by all means, but be mindful that when you may need it most their customer service might evaporate.","May 25, 2019","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

1214,"This was my first trip to France so it was surprising that there was no AC in the hotel, just a FAN! I don't know if this is a French custom (the LOUVRE didn't have AC!) but heading to the hotel, the Uber driver didn't use AC either, just the windows were open. Luckily it's Spring with cool nights and the windows were able to open.Second complaint is that at breakfast, even at 9:30am (they close at 10) was pretty full. Since I was by myself, they wouldn't seat me as they only had tables for four. The ones for two were all used. So they suggested I get my food and take it to the bar across the way.Other than that, this is a fairly nice hotel. The room was clean and a decent size. The bed was comfortable and desk was functional. It's located in a safe area, even the police station is minutes walk away!Hommie was great! Even though she's at the front desk, she was willing to help out at the bar when no one was there!","May 8, 2019","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

1215,"Easy to get to if you don't use the Parishuttle. A very nice quiet location on the river next to a very interesting mechanical bridge with nice views. You can watch the brilliant game of 'Bouls' well in to the evening which they used to play in the city on the banks of the Seine. Very handy for the Metro in to the city (of which only 5% of the stations have escalators). There are grocery shops for daily supplies and romantic inexpensive corner restaurants/bars to get the flavour of Parisians. The hotel rooms are modern and clean but NO SAFE so you will have to drag your belongings around with you or leave then in reception. Coffee and Tea making facilities are good. Hanging area for clothes but no drawers, otherwise ok.The staff are brilliant, polite and communicative with lots of advice if needed. (Good maps too!) .Breakfast is a hot buffet and just what you need to start the days touring. Tour operators will pickup from this hotel too!

1223,Location- loved it. Off the beaten path for first time Paris visitors but nice to walk around in a more residential area. Lots of little restaurants and bars and very close to subway line.Room- I wish we had asked to be moved on first day of our 7 day trip. Had a top floor room. Size was nice with one large bed and a sofabed. Two major problems- Worst stained carpet I've seen and odors (two totally different types). When we walked in room and saw stains on carpet I thought they had just shampooed since it was very discolored in most places. I never thought a Holiday Inn would put someone in a room with that carpeting. Also since it was raining out I thought maybe the previous guest or housekeeper tracked water in from the balcony. We unpacked and went out for the day. The next morning it was evident that this was just a terribly stained carpet. If this room was acceptable to them then the others were probably the same I thought.The room also had either a VERY strong cleaning smell or on the last 2-3 days was a terrible sewer smell from the bathroom. We had to keep bathroom door shut so we could tolerate it in the bedroom. Neighbors had the same odor issue.The restaurant breakfast was decent. No changes throughout our 7 days but didn't bother us too much.Front desk nice enough. Never said hello or any acknowledgment when we walked by the desk a few times a day. It would have been nice.Will we return? Probably not. I expect better quality of the room.,"January 16, 2019","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

The view of the canal was lovely, and it would be a very pleasant route for joggers in the summer. The heater functioned well. However, the room was not very well-lit, which was more inconvenient than uncomfortable. The breakfast provided (for free by the way!) was also a pleasant surprise - while the eggs and sausages were not fantastic, the wide variety of breads, spreads and cereal was very satisfying and all delicious. The location of the hotel is further from the main attractions of Paris than most hotels, and you need to take a 20/30min metro ride to most attractions. However, this provided a quieter and safer neighborhood to return to each night, and also allowed us to find restaurants that are locals’ favorites. Given the price of this hotel, I find my stay there exceeding my expectations. I highly recommend it for people with a tighter budget, who wouldn’t mind waking earlier and walking further.","January 6, 2019","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

If your budget doesn't stretch to a 4 or 5 star hotel in Paris, then we would recommend this one be considered.","August 30, 2018","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

The hotel is ideally located to visit Paris, the area safe, pleasant and one street away from local shops and metro.The hotel itself is spacious and clean, with good facilities and the staff provide great customer service (though some don’t speak English).The bedroom was unexpectedly spacious, clean and had a most delightful view of the canal. An added bonus was the secured underground car park where we left our car (as the hotel is only two kms away from the périphérique, it’s very easy to access). Highly recommended.","August 15, 2018","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

1242,"We stayed in this hotel last month and had a really good time. The hotel is in a beautiful area of paris full of families and little cafes. It is just a minute or two away from Riquet station which gives you access into the city centre very quickly and it is very cheap too. The rooms were nice, but nothing spectacular. They were imaculately clean as usual and were nice and modern. The canal views were an extra bonus too. For once the TV in the hotel had a really good selection of TV channels which a lot of holiday inns neglect. The bathroom was also nice too and spotless. The breakfast selection was good but not great with a very large continental selection and some very basic hot food. The rest of the food let us down greatly, here's why. The night we arrived there were three members of staff working, 2 receptionists and someone on the bar. At the bar you can order a limited selection of hot food. As it was the night of the world cup semi-final with France vs Belgium the bar was quite busy as they were showing the football. The poor staff were run off their feet. Our pizzas were burned to a crisp and were very poor quality. I ordered a pizza with chicken and bacon on it and I expected that cheese would already be on it. Nope, it was just base with a drizzle of tomato sauce and bacon, no chicken and no cheese. the other meal my Mum had which was a stew like thing was cold and not very nice. But i sympathise with the staff as it was only three people to cook the food, work at reception, work at the bar, clean up the plates and make cocktails. Other than those issues the staff seemed incredibly nice and the hotel was lovely.","August 8, 2018","24    Holiday Inn Express Paris-Canal de la Villette

They also speak English and very friendly. (If you’re a tourist coming from the U.S just ask for tips and direction around Paris. They’re available to help)-The reception area smells good and it’s clean- Breakfast is average. They have baguette, good croissants. I would suggest to add eggs.-Hotel is clean only at the reception area, hallways, elevators, and breakfast area, but not in the actual rooms.Cons;-Rooms have lots of stains. I suggest they should start to pay attention to this. The rooms need some extra level of cleaning because it’s getting old.- Aircon is not working properly- Hard to reach the receptionist. We tried reaching the front desk fasking for a towel, but there’s no clear information how. I suggest they should place a clear post or information to reach the front deskOverall, our stay is okay. Nice place with a canal view. Close to a Metro station. I hope they do some improvement with the Aircon and cleanliness and breakfast menu.

Reception staff have been outstanding even advising us of restaurants to eat at. Yes you need to use the metro to get around, but that is half the fun and if we can master anyone can.

Only 4 sets of towels... seems odd that this happens so often with a booking for 5, but quickly remedied with a call to reception. Looks like the bathrooms may have had baths once, but have been replaced by large showers. The double door on the shower is just ok, and the single door that doubles as a bathroom door swinging one way and then also a toilet door swinging the other way doesn't work well at all.Some shelf space, a desk, hangers, reasonably comfortable bed.

We booked last minute for a ticket going to the Louvre, there Chef de rèception is very helpful, Pierrick Dhennin, very professional and assisted us to get our tickets fast, as it was our last day in Paris and flying early the next day.

1262,"Stayed here for 3 nights during the recent heatwave with temperatures in the mid-90’s. The rooms were all nicely appointed, and very cool! The rooms are truly French— not a lot of extra space, but nicely appointed, with stocked mini fridge. Beautiful, modern , but small bathroom. Large windows look out onto the very Parisian street views below. There is an elevator— but it’s quite tiny and works better as a luggage lift. It stops halfway between floors, so hauling luggage a few steps up or down a tiny winding staircase is inevitable. Still, with its great location and close proximity to wonderful restaurants, I give it high marks! Would recommend to anyone traveling to Paris to sightsee! Buffet breakfast is available daily in the basement for 13 Euros. Another plus is the shuttle to the airport for 70 Euros. Prompt service and very reasonably priced—Uber would’ve cost our group 140 Euros. Arrange by speaking to the Front Desk a day or so ahead.","July 1, 2019","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

Restaurants nearby are good.The obvious charm is that it is a small boutique experience in a busy city. Yes, the rooms are small which is expected in an old, city hotel. The rooms are clean. Comfort of the bed pillows and bedding is medium and could be upgraded as would the quality of the offerings for breakfast. I could see how getting the correct temp of the room would be challenging. It was either too hot or too cold in a mild December. Most of the Staff did their best to be accommodating. WiFi was spotty which sometimes does not matter but it was an unfortunately crucial time for us to remain connected to our home.Noise can be heard from elsewhere in the hotel, revelers from the avenue and neighbors down the street so you must be used to sleeping in city. It was no fault on the part of the hotel but there was a party (champagne popping, loud music, dancing and signing) directly across the street that went until 3 in the morning on a Midweek night.

It's in a great location with lots of great restaurants and close to all major sites. It's quieter at night than the hotel we initially stayed at by the Notre Dame which was quite noisy until late at night. The room was on the smaller side but was nicely decorated in soft neutral colours with a comfortable bed. One big bonus was that they also had an elevator which a lot of the smaller boutique hotels don't have. They have a buffet breakfast as well that we didn't get a chance to try.

They helped us find terrific restaurants, navigate the metro, and dealt with my dietary restrictions deftly and kindly. The rooms are really nice and the Isle is a quiet oasis in the evenings. The rooms are not all the same size, we were lucky and got a big one (for Paris), but you might ask when you book. We reserved three months in advance. The location is amazing -- literally in the heart of Paris with metro stops close by. We will return!","September 24, 2018","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

1273,"This is my first review on trip advisor and I had to write one because I am still in shock at the rudeness my husband and I experienced. We walked into the hotel lobby a few days ago and we were unsure we were in the right hotel. When an older white haired man approached I said hello and asked if we were in the right hotel. His response was, ""Can you read?"" I was shocked. I did not know if he was joking or not. I found out he was not joking when he proceeded to barrage us and tell us that we needed to ask him the question again and phrased how he wanted it asked. What?? Then he continued by stating, ""In France education comes first, not like in America"". Never will I stay here.","August 27, 2018","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

1274,We really enjoyed are stay at Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle. We booked direct so all of our correspondence was with someone at the hotel. They were extremely responsive to our questions. When we checked in the the staff was friendly and helpful; they really made us feel welcome. The room was very nice and most important the air conditioning worked as expected; it was a hot couple of days. The location is perfect; not terribly crowded outside the hotel and you are right next to Notre Dame. And easy access to a couple of Metro stations. I would definitely stay here again.,"August 16, 2018","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

1275,"The hotel has a great location to get to many places throughout the city. The staff got us into our rooms early and were very courteous about making us wait a limited amount of time. AC worked very well and shower was amazing. Checkout was easy and smooth, no issues with that process at all.The downsides we experienced:Toilet didn’t even half enough room for me to sit down with my legs straight and I am barely 5’11”, so beware anyone taller they may be squeezing in. This is somewhat made okay considering the size of the shower, however, which was very large.They require you leave the key at the front desk which seems charming and quaint at first, but we had to wait 5 minutes once as there was no one at the desk and we had to make loud noises in order to make clear our presence in the lobby, so clearly not that secure or safe for the keys to our room if we could have just grabbed the key and went up with no validation or human interaction.The first morning we had someone knock on our door while we were sleeping-in to “check the minibar”, which the housekeeping could easily accomplish while cleaning the room. It somehow took over 4 minutes to accomplish even though I informed her that we had only drank a bottle of water, but she still came in while my wife was in bed, and she did not do anything while in the room that we dubbed worthy of invading our privacy. She then asked if we had received a do not disturb sign, which we had not, and she promptly got us one. Despite this, on our second day we had her knocking on the door by 10:30am, then 11am again, all the while the sign we were given by her saying to clearly leave the room alone for now. My wife was woken up from her nap twice before our flight out that evening. I had to say we were in the room both times, the second time they started unlocking the door (clearly moving the “privacy please” sign aside to access the key hole) before I called out. I understand wanting to clean the room and keep the minibar stocked, but continuously knocking on your guests door and entering their room uninvited to do menial tasks lost the 5th star from us. There is a certain level of privacy that maybe only Americans expect in a hotel, and this was vastly different from experiences we have had at any hotel in our lives. All in all a lovely hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff, but a few things could be changed a little in order to make this a Five Star hotel, in my opinion. No issues in cleanliness, friendliness, helpfulness, location, amenities, etc. It is simply an execution of daily room maintenance that needs to be toned down or addressed.I highly recommend you stay here.","August 8, 2018","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

1277,"If you're looking for a boutique hotel in Paris the Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle is an excellent choice. It is less than a 15-minute walk to Notre Dame, on a quiet one-way street with virtually no noise at night. There are many restaurants in the area. Breakfast was excellent without being lavish. Rooms were a bit snug but OK. They have an elevator, though depending on where you are you might still have to walk up or down half a floor. I would guess that they have about twelve rooms, perhaps a few more. Staff was very helpful. They own three vans they use for airport pick-ups and other local transport (we also used them to go to Versailles), and the two drivers we used were careful drivers and nice to talk to. I would go to that hotel again.","July 20, 2018","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

It's a ten-minute walk to Notre Dame Cathedral and another five minutes to the Sainte Chapelle, A few minutes walk in another direction and you're at a Métro station. The hotel is clean, the beds are comfortable, the breakfast (not included) is a good value. The bathrooms are small, and storage for clothes is minimal. The staff is very helpful.

1279,"We stayed six nights at Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle and could not have been more pleased with the level of service, comfort and convenience. Everything from the communication regarding reservations to check out was handled with promptness and efficiency. The friendly staff were so helpful and patient with us - we are non-French speaking guests and were very appreciative of their assistance in everything from transportation to restaurant suggestions. The hotel arranged for transportation from the airport and this was prompt, convenient and reasonably priced. This location can not be beat. We were literally minutes away from Notre Dame, a short walk from the Louvre, and the Isle is picturesque, quaint and surprisingly quiet in the evening. We were close to the metro and train, and restaurants in the immediate area were quite good and surprisingly reasonable price-wise. The hotel itself is four floors of rooms with four rooms on our floor. There is a breakfast room in the cellar (not free, but reasonably priced with coffee, fruit, yogurt, pastry, boiled eggs - an easy and convenient start to the day). Breakfast is serve-yourself style, so don't be surprised when you are not waited upon. Our room was on the first floor up from reception, and it was comfortably appointed with large windows. All Paris hotel rooms are small, but we were pleasantly surprised to find that we had enough room to unpack and stow suitcases out of sight. We had a nice view of the corner and draperies were sufficient to black out room at night. There was very little street noise after 9pm. The only ""noise"" we heard was when other guests were directly outside our door in the small vestibule - doors opening or closing and conversation. On one occasion when guests got a little loud in this area, staff were quick to come up stairs and ask them to be quiet. Linens are good quality, beds are firm and comfortable, and the shower was awesome! The room was clean and maid service was prompt and thorough. Toiletries were very nice - shampoo, body wash and lotion, so if you use hair conditioner you might want to bring your own as it's not provided. There is a small safe in the closet. If I had one suggestion, it would be that they could put a hook or bar on the door to hang towels. We didn't need to use the heater, but there was one in main room and in bath.We loved our stay here and can't say enough great things about this experience. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Paris and we are already talking about returning. Thank you to everyone at Hotel Saint Louis en l'Isle for making our stay so perfect.","May 12, 2018","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

We were the only guests waiting.1- I speak French fluently 2nd mother tongue so there is no way he could understand me and made me as2- He could not find the online booking despite our evidences - eventually he managed it - clearly he is in the wrong job and did not give a good impression of the hotel.3- He was on shift on 04.03.18 in the afternoon should the Direction decide to train him on 'Les Bonnes Mannieres' Other than that, the rooms are small but OK.

The rooms are tight and there is a tiny elevator and some steep spiral stairs. Also not super welcoming to families, the man at the desk often told us to quiet down after we were trying to get all of us in our room (2 rooms, party of 6). But all that aside the location is really unbeatable, close to Notre Dame and the Ile de la Cite metro stop is really close by too.

1290,"This is not our first visit to the Saint-Louis, and we will return for our next visit. The hotel is quintessential Paris - charming and quaint. The rooms are smallish, but that is not unusual for authentic Paris, and the lift/stair situation may be challenging for some (curvy stairs and the elevator opens between floors to the curved stairs). Be prepared for the daily 8 am trash pick up, and the possibility of some late night revelry on the weekends, also not atypical in Paris. Bernard and Denis, who have both been there for many, many years, add to the charm of the Saint-Louis in many ways, and while I do not know the names of the other reception gentleman, they were also very nice and helpful.

There is a bar just up the road so rooms facing the street can be noisy. Not a problem for us. The location is perfect with multiple metro stations within a 5 to 10 minute walk. The RER line is close for easy transfers from CDG airport (pack light for this). Also a bus stop close by. Many fabulous restaurants both pricy and reasonable within easy walking distance.

1294,"Upon arriving via a very wonderful and efficient shuttle, we were greeted by a very odd person called Bernard. We were tired and wanted to get settled. Bernard proceeds to take about 30 minutes to get us checked in !!! He makes fun of guests as they walked through the lobby - very strange and scary person. Our room was on the first floor and according to the listing we responded to , was suppose to have air-conditioning. We were shown the air-conditioner controls and we assumed that it worked. The room was very warm when we entered but we assumed it was because it had been closed up. We unpacked and set out to explore Paris. Upon returning we tried to cool down the room to no avail. We could not leave the windows open as we were ground floor and anyone could climb over a 3 foot plexiglass guard on the window. Needless to say - we did not sleep well at all. The next morning I informed Bernard about the air conditioning not working. He stood up - made a dramatic performance of walking to the lobby air conditioner control - slapped the control a few times and said, "" I know nothing about fixing air conditioners!"" I asked him if he could call to have someone fix it and he said he would. Four hours later he still had not called and obviously he never did! Upon returning to the USA we discovered other people had complained about no air a month before we arrived! They knew it was not working when we checked in and did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation. I am 72 years old and have never been treated so badly by any hotel in my life! Because of the situation I had what we call ""prickly heat"" all over my body. I actually dreaded returning to our room each evening because it was hotter inside our room than outside. Deplorable condition! Ruined my vacation but stuck it out because this trip was for my daughter and granddaughter. I will never stay there again because of the terrible PR shown to us. If you advertise having ""air"" and it breaks down - then at least inform us of the situation so we have a choice of staying or leaving. Not being told the truth I cannot abide. Now for the plus side of our stay. Location was fantastic with restaurants and sights so close. The shuttle service was on time both ways and the drivers were awesome. Shower in our room was wonderful but using it made our room hotter. The Parisians were so friendly and helpful everywhere we went outside the hotel. Love Paris but have bad taste in my mouth from the stay here.","September 7, 2017","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

1295,"THis is a very Quaint hotel in an historic building. One of the most unique configurations I have ever seen, but definitely not for anyone with a handicap, as the elevator stops between floors. You have several steps to go up or down from the elevator to the rooms. No doubt the elevator (which will only fit two people) was added in long after the hotel was built. The rooms were very nice and comfortable (but small by modern standards). The rooms were very clean and we found the bed very comfortable (on the firm side). I noticed a previous review complained about being hot, but there was a thermostat in out room that ran an air conditioner making the room temperature perfect for our desires. The staff were friendly and accommodating and booked tours for us. We had friends who recommended this hotel to us and I am sure glad they did.

1296,"Location can't be beat. Easy access to everything you want to see, in a charming neighborhood with lots of great restaurants and shops, creperies, Berthillion ice cream, boulangeries, grocery, you name it, it is steps from your door. I loved this neighborhood and can't imagine ever staying elsewhere now. There is always free entertainment on the Pont Saint Louis, and it's just an amazing neighborhood. Rooms are very clean, and the shower is great! Great water pressure and plenty of hot water...wonderful after a day of walking all over Paris. Hotel staff, with the exception of one individual, was very kind and helpful. The hotel's shuttle service to and from the airport was very convenient. Yes, you can get a cab for cheaper but you can't beat the convenience. Our drivers were both right on time and very accommodating.Besides the great location, I chose this hotel because it had air conditioning. It's purely a matter of comfort for me, but for my 72 year old mother it is really an essential thing. However, during our visit, the air conditioning in our room did not work. When we informed the front desk person, he really didn't care. He was sort of an odd duck who seemed to enjoy annoying guests of the hotel He put on a big dramatic show of saying he would get it fixed, but he was obviously insincere and it was never fixed during the 8 days we were there. It would not have been bad if we could have kept our window open, because the temps were cool in the evening, but we had a ground level room that faced the street and only a 3 ft high or so plexiglass barrier at the bottom of the window so we could not keep it open while we slept. Anyone walking on the street would see right into our room and could easily hop over the plexiglass to get into the room. As a result, it was stifling hot in the room at night. After the first evening my mom asked for a fan, which they gave her, which at least circulated the air in the room, but it was still very hot. It really put a damper on an otherwise nice stay, and because of this I would select another hotel on the island the next time I visit. After checking reviews on another site, I saw that several reviewers complained about the air not working at least a month before our stay, and they obviously never bothered to fix it. Really blew me away to see that since when we stayed they acted like it was was a recent occurrence. Rooms are very small but that was not unexpected. There is really not room for large luggage..you basically have 2 or three feet on either side of your bed. This wasn't a big deal to us but if you are expecting an American sized hotel room you will be very disappointed.","September 1, 2017","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

There are only a few rooms (about 20) in the entire hotel. Step out of the door and you are only a few steps away from wonderful, small restaurants, creperie and boulangerie. At the end of the island there were several open air cafes. Since we had such wonderful weather, we chose to get our coffee and pastries across the street and eat while sitting on the wall about the Seine River or in the park behind Notre Dame.

1300,"We've stayed here before and we'll stay again. It is a lovely hotel in the center of the universe. We always ask for a high floor room facing the street. Open the windows in the morning and watch the children walking to school up the block, here the church bells ring, smell the croissants baking at the Boulangerie (well, maybe you just imagine that!). We love this small hotel with Parisian charm and personal service. We never want to stay anywhere else","May 28, 2017","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

The shower is a revelation, and the water pressure is capable of stripping paint (absolute perfect after a long day walking around Paris). Hotel staff are friendly and exceedingly helpful. We left my wife's GHD straighteners in the room and the maid put them in the safe and the hotel returned them safely. Very enjoyable stay, would definitely stay again.

The location is great-- cozy and away from the rush of ""big Paris"" but close to sites and transportation. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

1305,"This was our second stay at this hotel on the beautiful Ile Saint Louis. Last time we had the largest room on the top floor, but found that due to the sloping roof we were unable to stand upright in the shower. We downgraded to the fourth floor and a superior room which was fairly small but at least we could stand up in the shower.Sadly, I noticed a fair bit of wear and tear in the hotel – loose door knobs etc. The worst problem was when we wanted to use the iron and ironing board to press some clothes it turned out that the only ironing board was broken. They promised to replace it but we stayed four days and it was always unavailable. Fortunately, we had a travel iron, but ironing on the floor is not terribly successful. This is not a particularly cheap hotel so it was disappointing that they couldn’t replace this item.We did not eat breakfast in the hotel. While it was no doubt much cheaper than outside cafes, it is served in a depressing cavelike room in the basement with no view. With the amazing Café St Regis just over the road with magnificent eggs and croissants and people watching it was a no brainer to eat there each day instead.The location of the hotel is perfect. You can cross the bridges to the Marais or the Left Bank and easily access the metro or the RER. The main street of the Ile has cute shops, together with wonderful fromageries and bakeries as well as a Nicholas wine shop.On our next trip to Paris we will probably stay elsewhere, not that the hotel is bad, but it is quite expensive for what it is and it would be good to experience staying in another part of Paris.","March 11, 2017","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

1308,"On a previous trip to Paris, we enjoyed our visit to Ile St-Louis and knew that when we returned, we would stay on the Ile. Our Internet search and all the reviews helped us pick Hotel Saint-Louis en I'lsle. Thank you Trip Advisor and all you contributors.The Hotel was just as all the favorable reviews indicate. We stayed on the top floor, Room 502, which is one of the larger rooms (Triple Room ""Top Floor""). No complaints on the room and would stay in 502 again. All of the staff were very friendly. Prior to arrival, I had several email correspondences with Denis who promptly would return them with questions/concerns answered (consider the 8 hour time difference if you send an email). About a week before our arrival, I asked Denis if he could make a dinner reservation and he sent back our confirmation. The Hotel has someone at the lobby desk 24/7.First timers to Paris, the rooms are small so please do not complain. The buildings are old, very old, please do not complain.We did use the car service to and from the CDG. It's pricey if you compare it to the train, but we enjoyed this personal service and would do it again. So staying here is nice if you like a quiet respite. Depending if you turn right or left, a short, leisure walk (10 to 15 minutes) can put you into the bustle and noise of the lower Marais, St Germain, or the Latin Quarter. Less than a 10 minute walk can get you to Pont Marie, Line 7 Metro, and then be at the Opera House in 15 minutes. Change trains at Chatelet and you can be at the Arc de Triomphe in less than 20 minutes. The Ile offers decent shops and good restaurants. Hotel Saint-Louis offers you a quiet, friendly, and very nice stay on the Ile. It's Paris, it's ALL good.","January 12, 2017","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

1313,"We came here for the location, and it was the right choice to make.ADVANTAGES:--5 minutes to Notre Dame, maybe 10 to Sainte Chapelle, and to all that the Ile de la Cite has to offer--45 minute walk takes you through Luxembourg Gardens and on to Bon Marche and Hermes and the fun of the left bank--another 45 or so, not sure because we kept stopping along the Seine to shoot photos, takes you to Orsay or the Louvre, or the L'Oranerie**if you like to walk, this is a perfect locationBut, if you're tired or it's raining, the Pont Marie metro is just 10 minutes away--advantages also include a strikingly cordial management and staff, with a manager willing to give us a 40 Euro discount for the inconvenience of their hot water system hitting a snag, condemning us to icy showers one morning and a delayed departure another.DISADVANTAGES:--tiny double room, with no more than 3 feet clearance on each side of the bed (where we had to put our bags) and no more than 4 at the foot, where the bathroom door dominated access. French hotel rooms are know for being tiny, but be prepared. --a sofa in the lobby by the manager's desk, but no real place where one might sit a while, except, of course, one of the many cafes along the Ile.--a limited breakfast in a basement room that surely once was the ""cave"" of the place, but, again, the location of the hotel places you within 50 feet of three creperies if you can wait for a late start.When we come back, we might go to HomeAway to look for an apartment and have more space, but it would be hard to do better than this location and these incredibly nice people.","October 24, 2016","25    Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle

1327,"Where to begin with this awful place...the walls are paper thin between rooms, I heard every word of conversation each night from my neighbors, and they weren't talking at an unreasonable level. I reserved two rooms for me and my friend, we both had our 'do not disturb' placards on our doors, we were travelling abroad and didnt want someone in our rooms with access to our things - the hotel ignored the signs and cleaned the rooms anyways, and hid the dnd placards. When I called the front desk to ask why they ignored their own signs, she stated they checked to see if we were sleeping first and they didnt see the problem since we werent there, I then read them the language that is on their dnd door signs which states 'i do not want my room cleaned' - she said sorry and hung up. Then there's the 'room service' - after decades of travel, I've never seen anything so awful. I ordered a beef dish with potato salad and a soda, which costed about $40 US - what I received was some rolled up cold lunch meat and potato salad so vinegary it was inedible, it was in a plastic container as if they got the meal from a convenience store take out, this was bad food for the US, let alone Paris, maybe the worst food I've ever had anywhere, and for an outrageous price. The a/c in my room would shut off for no reason intermittenly and the unit made some horrendous noises as if it was leaking water.

And it did not hurt that the price was very reasonable for Paris.","May 24, 2019","27    Hotel du College de France

1336,"My husband and I stayed here about 6 years ago and were eager to enjoy this hotel again. We liked it’s quiet location on the left bank, about a block from Boulevard Saint-Germain and a short walk to the Seine. There is a tiny elevator which we really appreciated at the end of a long day and when checking in and out. The lobby and breakfast areas are somewhat elegant yet inviting. Our room had two large windows that brought in a lot of light and air. As well, the lighting in the room and bathroom were exceptional. It may be the first hotel where I didn’t wish I’d brought a light bulb. The closest was very large with built-in shelves and a safe. Bed, pillows and bedding were very good. Plenty of convenient outlets. There is no AC but there was a ceiling fan and a vertical floor fan. Room also had a desk, two chairs, a built in shelf for your suitcase and several hooks on the wall near the door— a nice amenity for jackets and hats. Bathroom was spacious with a good tub/shower with quick and plentiful hot water. There were enough towels and towel bars and a built in shelf to store your toiletries. The only thing I would change in the room would be the carpeting. We had breakfast three times—price was extremely reasonable and the dining area felt like we were in a fine restaurant. The hostess was very pleasant and brought a pot of coffee and hot milk to our table. Three types of cold meats, two or three kinds of cheese, jams, baguettes, croissants, chocolate croissants, cereal, yogurt, cut up fresh fruit and whole fresh fruit were available. Three mornings we only wanted coffee and my husband went down and picked up a tray of coffee and hot milk. The front desk is staffed 24 hours per day, and without exception the staff were friendly and helpful. I frequently saw them helping other guests and they kindly made taxi reservations for us. Definitely the hotel for us when we next visit Paris!","May 23, 2019","27    Hotel du College de France

1341,"This has become my ""go to"" hotel for Paris stays. It is clean, modest and cozy and offers a reasonable moderate rate. I love the location in the Latin Quarter by the Cluny Museum, two metro stops, many bus lines. lots of restaurants, movie theatres, a variety of shops and the list goes on. As the name signifies, it is close to the College of France as well as other institutions of higher learning, such as the Sorbonne. I find it an easy walk from here to many attractions, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame, Seine, Hotel de Ville, Pantheon and Luxembourg Gardens. Our one-week December stay was my third in 2018 and we experienced no drawbacks. The staff, without exception, are friendly, professional, extremely helpful and gracious. Our room on the second floor, though small, had everything that we wanted, from a firm, comfortable bed to outstanding lighting and plenty of power points. It overlooked a courtyard so was absolutely quiet. Housekeeping kept the space immaculate. The mirrored closet offered plenty of space for our clothes with sufficient hangers and shelves. We enjoyed having a bit of desk space and two chairs. We opted to eat breakfast here three mornings. At 10 E (about $11.40 U.S.), I considered the small buffet to be good value with offerings such as a hot drink, bread, rolls, pastries, cheese, fruit salad, juice, water, sliced meats, eggsand cereals available.I look forward to another stay here in the spring. And, as always, I expect to find the best rate on the hotel's website.","January 2, 2019","27    Hotel du College de France

1363,"This boutique hotel in the Latin Quarter has easy access to a lot of cafes, a market, the metro and Notre Dame. So many cafes in that area that we never did try their €10 continental breakfast. Our room #523 was teeny tiny with just enough space to walk around the queen bed. The bathroom was also very small with a funny configuration and awkward with a step up into the shower. My husband (6’3”) and I (5’4”) could barely squeeze into the shower. Our daughter’s room #23 was slightly larger with a better toilet/sink configuration and tub/shower. In hindsight we should have switched rooms since we booked six nights. Paris was experiencing a heat wave the week we there and this hotel does not have air conditioning. The rooms are equipped with a ceiling and oscillating floor fan but it was so hot we had to open the windows and doors to get cool night air. Since both rooms faced the street, barking dogs, cars, trucks, motor cycles, and people partying made sleeping difficult. The double pane windows would have kept street noises to a minimum but without air conditioning, our room became a sauna as soon as we closed them. Our rooms were clean, the bed was comfortable and the staff are very helpful. Our daughter was scheduled to fly from Paris to Amsterdam the next day but at 14:00 hours Sunday afternoon she was notified that her flight on Monday was cancelled. As a result she had to depart immediately and the hotel did not charge her for the last night for which she was very grateful. ","July 10, 2018","27    Hotel du College de France

The bathroom was very small and had a hairdryer. Our room looked into an interior court so was very quiet. We didn’t have a car, but I believe the hotel does not have parking. Who would want a car in Paris anyway? The staff is quite helpful and speaks English. Our room price included breakfast, but frankly the breakfast was poor, and next time, we would book without breakfast and head out to a café. There is a tiny elevator for all floors except level 6.

Given that it is so close to bars and restaurants it can be loud on the streets at night.

1376,After having our flight cancelled by Air France we needed to find a hotel for the night. Having stayed here before we knew it was a safe bet so booked it quickly before someone else did! Both rooms were clean and spacious. One room had a street view which was really nice. How can you not like watching Paris go by. The second room unfortunately had a view of a vent pipe and interior rooftop. It was private but it could be made to look much nicer. Having said that it was very quiet. The staff at the hotel were polite and friendly at all times and kept our luggage so we could spend our last day without taking it with us.,"April 12, 2018","27    Hotel du College de France

The rooms are well equiped and clean. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, all of them. The only complaint was the breakfast did not have much food left on the one day we tried it, but we arrived a little late. It was cheaper than a restaurant but not much selection of food.

I think it's the staff who really make this hotel work. Well done to you all!! The rooms are not big. We had one with a small balcony which was great to look over Paris and listen to Notre Dame's Bells, but very clean and large French windows. Maybe two English channels on tv. Safe in room. Small foyer where breakfast is served. Ten euros. Quiet street near the metro and hundreds of restaurants!!! Ten minutes Notre Dame. Eiffel Tower 30 minute walk. I particularly liked the Latin Quarter where the hotel is located. Rue mouffetard worth a look.

As it was the first trip to Europe for both of us, I wanted to be sure that every detail of this experience was special, including even the name of our hotel in Paris, reflective of my son’s name. Not only did Jack’s Hotel live up to each and every expectation, reflected on their website, but was essentially what made our stay in Paris one of the best of our lives. From the moment we were greeted with such a warm welcome upon our arrival which continued throughout our stay (even the late conversations while awaiting our Uber Eats), to walking into our room and opening the window to inhale the beauty of Paris, there isn’t any doubt in my mind why my son declared Jack’s Hotel to be the absolute favorite one we have ever stayed in.I say, please don’t change a thing and keep it as quaint and amazing as it is right now!","June 7, 2019","28    Jack's Hotel

If you're a bit taller there's not enough room for your feet when sitting on the toilet. I think it's a 1x1 m space.The elevator is a nightmare. Two people with their luggage can barely fit.The breakfast is almost a joke. If you want to eat after 9 AM you can barely find anything left. The kitchen staff doesn't refill the trays. We heard them yelling when we went to the reception to complain about this and the receptionist asked them for clarifications. Very rude. We paid for 4 breakfasts: in the first day we ate a croissant with a slice of ham and drank a coffee and a juice, the 2nd and 3rd day we got some extra cheese and some bread and on the 4th one we left very early and were not even offered a coffee or something.

1422,"In all the major/capital cities in Europe & North America you are never going to get something for nothing when it comes to hotels. It is easy to be picky and compare prices with provincial towns. For Paris, this hotel is pretty good. I was pleased with the price I paid via one of the large internet hotel booking sites. The room was spotless and we did not experience much noise from the adjoining rooms unlike on other occasions at other hotels in this city. The bed was comfortable. I will concede that the room was small, however given the amount of time we spent in it, when asleep it could have been huge and I wouldn't have been aware. The en-suite bathroom area was tight, but again spotless and the shower was good. Breakfast was buffet style consisting of the usual pastries, ham, salami, boiled egg, toast etc, but the room was narrow and a tight squeeze getting past tables, but hey, if that is the only real negative... All the staff were friendly and helpful with Metro directions etc. The hotel is literally only 5 minutes walk from the Campo Formio Metro station on Line No 5 between the Gare d'Austerlitz and the Place d'Italie, 5 minutes to the south. Whilst there is no restaurant at this hotel, near the Place d'Italie is the old Butte aux Cailles street which has good value bars, bistros and restaurants. The hotel staff will point you in the right direction. Next time we are in Paris for a fix of rugby we will definitely look to staying here again.","March 6, 2018","28    Jack's Hotel

1423,"First things first, the staff is very friendly and helpfull, but that is pretty much the only good side. Oh, and the place is on the green line - direct line to Bir-Hakim (Eiffel) and Trocadero POI, at just a few minutes walk to the station. The rooms are very small. And by that I mean there is no place for two skinny people to cross paths in front of the bed. Very clean, but really small room.The worst part was that cold air was coming from under the windows (we had to put pillows and T-shirts to stop it). We ask the front desk for a solution, but nothing was changed. Having our trip in february, it was quite an irritating situation.Next thing is the really loud elevator. In the middle of the night, lound metallic noises were coming from what I belive was the lift’s counterweight. If you are a light sleep type of person, you are in for quite a challenge. I will not go into details on the shower doors and other poorly installed items because I know this is not JW Marriot, and I am aware of the price I’ve paid. Still, the hotel is advertised as a 3* establishment and I find it to be far from that 8.1 satisfaction score (how did they get that high!). I am sorry, but all in all, make your reservations early and find something better.","February 5, 2018","28    Jack's Hotel

I had a great view of the city and could watch the Eiffel Tower light shows from my room - with a slight obstacle - an unexpected surprise! Breakfast simple with delicious croissants and rolls. Coffee in room, as well as a safe. All nice touches for a very easy going short time in Paris. Metro Place d'Italie is a four minute walk where lines 5 and 6 meet. OrlyBus is also an easy connection 4 stops away. I had an 8am flight and had no problem making it when starting at 530am on the Metro.

1431,"Moi, je suis American et j'avait rester dans l'hotel Jack trois fois. I first visited Jack's back in 1988 before Jack's remade itself into the excellent hotel it is today. But even then Jack's was a quiet hotel with very friendly staff and a place where a stranger to Paris could feel safe. Today Jack's remains a hotel with very helpful and friendly staff and a great value hotel in a great location near Place D'Italy. I should mention that the mall at Place D'Italy also underwent a tremendous remake into a four star shopping centre. The rooms at Jack's will not be huge by American Standards (no, I am not putting America First....) but they are very clean, proper and up to date including WiFi and Digital Television. With Paris at your feet, Jack's is an excellent choice those travelers who want to be faithful to a budget but feel safe, secure and convenient. Each day I went out into the Great City of Paris with the help and directions provided by the staff and felt my belongings were in good hands.Thank you Jack's for being my home in Paris.

The staff were always courteous and knowledgable and went out of their way to answer any question we had about the city of Paris, as well as about the hotel itself. The hotel does offer a reasonable breakfast option, but we chose not to go that route as there are many places to eat in the vicinity of the hotel. It is Paris afterall, and there are cafe's on every street corner! :-) The only thing that caught us off guard when looking over the final bill was the city tax (or tourism tax), which is an additional 10% on top of the hotel price (this was not made clear when initially booking the hotel)...but I suppose that is to be expected when travelling to a city such as Paris.....Overall, a very good hotel, so highly recommend staying here when coming to Paris.","July 13, 2018","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

We didn’t have breakfast but I read there was a nice Patisserie down the road but I could not find this, but when in a city like Paris food isn’t a problem, you’re only a short distance from somewhere to eat.The hotel is 10 minute walk from Arc de Triomphe.

However, the friendly receptionist switched to English with no problem and was friendly throughout the check-in process. I was then shown to my room by a young man originally from Bangladesh. During the short ride in the lift to the 7th floor, we managed to discuss various locations in the south of England as well as our favourite dishes at Bengali restaurants in the UK. It is a small hotel in a small Parisian street and so of course the rooms will not be too big, but mine was clean, comfortable and had all the amenities I needed.

1461,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of April for a long weekend seeing the sights of Paris with my parents. This hotel is in a good location, close to restaurants and the metro station. The rooms were small (as people have said) but we hardly spent any time in them as we were out and about every day! Bed was comfortable and room kept nice and clean. I really enjoyed the macaroons on arrival! :-) The Reception staff were really friendly and always on hand if you needed any advice on how to get to places. We only ate breakfast in the hotel once as this was not included in the price, it was a good breakfast with enough choice. We got breakfast one day from the local patisserie down the road, the pastries were delicious! All in all a good hotel at a reasonable price that I would recommend to friends and family.","May 20, 2017","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

1462,"PROSThe location of the hotel was the only bright spot in our stay. The lady manning the reception during the mornings was very professional and very friendly. Also the second lady we met during our stay whose name eludes me was quite friendly too. CONSWe checked in to Westside on the 6th evening. The lady who checked us in was professional and courteous. The lady in the morning every day was also very professional and courteous. But there was a gentleman we dealt with in the evening every time who was eternally grumpy and seemed to react like we were an interruption to what he was doing. The Hotel rooms were very small for a 4 star hotel and not what we expected. The breakfast was one table with bread and croissants and few other knick knacks. You would definitely expect more from a 4 Star hotel. On our second day we ordered room service and I ordered Lentil Soup, Lebanese Platter and French Fries. We waited for more than 90 minutes and after multiple follow ups, I got Lentil Soup, a plate of cheese and no French fries. I did not have dinner that night. Apparently this hotel does not have "" Room Service"" in house. They just order from a nearby restaurant and so there is a lot lost in translation. My Sister's family who were staying with us could not get water delivered either. Overall it was a very disappointing stay especially after travelling through Italy, Switzerland and getting some amazing service from similar sized and similar category hotels. As mentioned, the plus points were the location and the friendly lady receptionists who were professional and courteous. The remaining staff were quite unfriendly and we felt quite unwelcome (including the ladies at the breakfast who were very curt). I provide this feedback as a constructive feedback so the hotel can view the service from the perspective of the recipient of such services and look at ways to enhance the same.","April 11, 2017","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

1463,"I had to pay the breakfast charge that was about 40Euro before checking out. However, the lady from the reception desk wanted to charge me 300Euro and she gave me an attitude that she thought I didn't speak English before I was even going to ask her any question. I was confused and told her that I had paid everything through Hotel.com and I asked her what 300Euro was coming from. She told me it was ""government tax"" and did not bother explaining anything further. She went on and had my credit card wiped and made me sign the bill. This is my first time to France and I had a flight to catch so I did not want to start a fight with her that might ruin my day and I did really act like a gentleman. Fortunately, at the end, she somehow realized she made a mistake by herself and returned my money. However, this is a very unpleasant experience.","March 19, 2017","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

This year I lived in room overlooking the main quiet street. Room was large enough and comfortable.

1469,"We stayed here last week 30thAugust - 1st September for 2 nights and found it to be a very nice hotel. As people have already mentioned the lift was very small, it says it takes 4 people we had a job with 2 of us and hubby had to bring the case up separately. The room was clean but could have done with decorating, the corner of the ceiling had had a leak from above, I would think, because it was brown and flaking. The view was terrible, right outside our window was an iron spiral fire escape and we looked onto the rooms opposite, but the room was clean and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was good with everything you would need including a hairdryer, and the bath had a shower over it,which my husband had to struggle to help me into to have my shower. Breakfast was continental or if you preferred there was scrambled eggs bacon and sausage. The young lady on breakfast duty was very polite and made sure there was hot food all the time. The front of house staff were very friendly and welcoming. There are plenty of eateries within walking distance, and the Arc De Triomphe and the Champs-Elysee were within walking distance if you feel so inclined, but because I am disabled i am not able to walk very far so we took a bus ride, and people were so kind, as soon as they saw my sticks they were offering me their seats. We got to the Arc De Triomphe only to find that the lift was not working, they said 4pm so we went and had lunch in a little pub just across from the 'Arc' called the 'Beer Station' which is on Bis Avenue and opposite 'The Lateral' and had the best French onion soup I have ever tasted. We went back to the 'Arc' and the lift was still not working so I told hubby one of us had to go to the top so he had to go. OMG I didn't realise there were so many steps poor man, there were over 300 of them!! but he did it and brought me a lovely present from the top. Buses to and from the 'Arc' are very frequent every 5 minutes. One thing I want to warn people about is the parking, there is none at the hotel and if you arrive at night it's not the easiest place to find, so look out for two small potted conifer trees these are each side of the doorway. The parking is in the multistory car park about 5-10 minutes walk from the car park back to the hotel but there are plenty of eateries on the walk back. The price was approx 32.50 Euros a night which seems quite steep to me. All in all a very nice hotel.","September 12, 2016","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

1472,"This was my second visit to Paris and upon arrival at our hotel I was pleased to find it was sort of out of the tourist centre. This seems odd because it is very centrally located to the Arc de Triomphe (an easy, though up hill walk) and this is right on the tourist heart but in the streets surrounding the hotel you really only see locals, lots of business people who reside there. Especially of an evening there are suits in all the surrounding restaurants and cafes. This gave a much welcome respite from the crazy tourist areas. We really enjoyed arriving back here each evening and having the flexibility to head for the tourist buses if we wanted. The only downside to this is that due to the proximity of all the professionals each morning, early, you could hear plumbing and elevators start going while (being on holiday) we tried to sleep in. My partner slept through but I'd be awake from about 6am-7am before the rush subsided and I fell back asleep for a bit longer. But this is to be expected from old buildings I guess.The hotel itself is very quaint and of a nice size. The staff were always very pleasant and very helpful and were fluent in English which helped us a lot as our French is pretty poor.We had a private balcony looking over the street and we loved this, it seems private balcony's might be rare in this hotel so if we were to go back we'd probably pay the extra to ensure we had one (I may be wrong here, this is just what it seemed).We liked this hotel, especially its location and we'd stay here again ","July 10, 2016","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

1476,"If you are unfamiliar with the economics of travel to Paris, i can sum it up in one word: expensive.We were very fortunate to find Hotel Westside as our home base for two nights in Paris as part of a longer vacation that continued to Barcelona.Communication with the hotel in advance of our stay was easy and prompt.Logisitics to finding the hotel were simple, especially coming from CDG in the early am. Simple take the RER B from CDG to Chatelet Les Halles metro station and transfer to the M1, getting off at Etoile Charles De Gaulles metro station(which is also the Arc de Triomphe. From there it was maybe an easy 15 minute stroll ... and you get to see the Arc de Triomphe every time you need to get on the metro.We arrived many hours ahead of checkin, and staff were friendly and welcoming and very accomodating to my limited French. In fact their English was great. They stored our bags for us, and we took off for a day of sightseeing.Rooms are compact, but conveniently appointed, as you will find with most boutique hotels in Europe.Staff provided many suggestions for activities, dining etc.Around the corner from the hotel there is an excellent boulangerie that is incredibly inexpensive with amazing pain au chocolat, pain au lait, macarons, etc.Lots of diining options near the hotel.Would definitley stay again and would definitely recommend this hotel to others looking for a comfortable base near the Champs Elysee.","March 23, 2016","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

1489,"Its location in a quiet street in one of the best areas of Paris gives this hotel a cozy atmosphere. The decor is simple and classy. Staff were friendly. I did not use the swimming pool and sauna, but it was nice to know it was available and for free. I liked that I could walk to many of the lovely restaurants in the area.","September 14, 2015","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

1490,"Hotel in great location close to buses , metro lines , some fantastic restaurants,mini mart and laundry.Stayed there for a week and it was excellent.Great staff especially night staff member Madey whose service standard is way above expectation.Rooms were a bit small but we were only there to sleep.Would be good if they could organise for a little close line in the bathroom.Apart from the couple of points previously mentioned I do rate this hotel.","September 8, 2015","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe

1491,"The space- Very small rooms as expected in Paris. Paper thin walls! Expect to hear the TV, blow dryer and conversations of adjacent rooms.The service- make sure to get your room keys if you check in early. We had reserved and confirmed to rooms on the same floor as we are travelling with our teen girls. Arrived at 11:30 and confirmed. Upon returning to the hotel at 3 to collect our keys the room numbers had been changed to different floors and different rooms ( no street view as earlier committed.) When asked why, we were told we could try a different hotel.Terrible service and attitude. Air BnB in Paris is the only way!","August 24, 2015","29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe
